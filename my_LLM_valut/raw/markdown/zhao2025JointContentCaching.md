Abstractâ In this paper, we consider an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-enabled mobile edge computing (MEC) network, where multiple UAVs with caching and computation functionalities are deployed to satisfy the heterogeneous content and service requests from the user equipments (UEs). In order to comprehensively characterize the capability of our considered network in satisfying the UEsâ requests, we define the weighted sum of the content cache hit ratio and the service delay shrinkage ratio as the average quality-of-experience (QoE) of our network and adopt it as the performance metric. Through analysis, we show how the average QoE of our network is dependent on the content cache and service placement decisions at the UAVs, as well as the computation task offloading decisions at the UEs, thus enabling us to formulate an average QoE maximization problem, subject to practical constraints on the UAVsâ caching and computation capabilities. To solve this NP-hard problem, we decompose it into two sub-problems, namely, the content cache and service placement optimization sub-problem and the task offloading optimization sub-problem. Gibbs samplingbased and matching game-based algorithms are proposed to efficiently solve these sub-problems iteratively. Via numerical results, we validate the effectiveness of our proposed algorithms. Compared to various benchmarks, we demonstrate that our proposed algorithms can significantly improve the average QoE

of our considered network, especially when the caching and computation resources of the UAVs are limited.

## I. INTRODUCTION

HE integrated ground-air-space networks have been envisioned as a pivotal component of the sixth-generation wireless networks, providing ubiquitous and seamless services for the devices across the globe [1]. In the integrated groundair-space networks, unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-enabled communications play an important role, due to the advantages such as high mobility, strong line-of-sight (LoS) links, and on-demand deployment [2]. In terms of applications, UAVenabled live streaming [3], virtual/augmented reality (VR/AR) [4], and emergency communications [5] are just a few examples.

On the other hand, mobile edge computing (MEC) has been regarded as a promising solution to meet the everincrease demands for computation, by shifting computation functionalities from remote cloud to the network edge in proximity to the user equipments (UEs) [6], [7]. Against this background, significant research efforts have been devoted to developing efficient MEC schemes that improve the qualityof-experience (QoE) of the UEs [8], [9], [10], [11], [12], [13], [14]. In these works, task offloading and service placement are two key design issues. In particular, task offloading refers to the scenarios where the UEs offload their computation tasks to the network edge, while service placement refers to the scenarios where the edge nodes need to be placed with certain applications (and the related libraries/databases) a priori in order to process the tasks offloaded by the UEs. Considering the scenarios of task offloading, the scheduling and offloading decisions for tasks updated by time-sensitive applications were jointly optimized in [8] to minimize the age of information (AoI) of the system. In [9], a computation task migration scheme among the MEC servers was proposed for minimizing the total delay of task completion. In [10], a graph neural network-based scheme was proposed to balance the computation load among the MEC servers. Note that in order to achieve efficient task offloading, it is presumed that the edge nodes have cached the corresponding services/applications for processing certain computation tasks [11], [12], making the service placement an equally important design aspect as task offloading, while has been receiving less attention. In [13] and [14], the service placement problem was considered in the ultra-dense small cell networks, in which service placement and computation offloading decisions were jointly optimized to minimize the computation delay cost and energy consumption.

Motivated by the benefits of the UAV-enabled communications and MEC, integrating MEC techniques into the UAV-enabled networks has been receiving significant research attention [15], [16], [17], [18], [19]. Specifically, in [15], a computation offloading and resource allocation problem was considered in the UAV-enabled MEC system. A Paretooptimal solution was proposed to achieve the trade-off between the UAVsâ energy consumption and task completion delay. In [16], a UAV-enabled wireless powered cooperative MEC system was considered. In this system, a UAV equipped with an energy transmitter and an MEC server provides both energy and computing services to the sensors. The frequency of the central processing unit (CPU) at the UAV, the UAVâs trajectory, the offloading decision, and the transmit power were jointly optimized to minimize the total required energy of the UAV. In [17], the UAV-mounted edge servers were considered to be dispatched to the appropriate hover locations for geographically merging tasks in several hotspot areas. An online dispatching algorithm was proposed to improve the resource utilization. In [18], the UAVâs trajectories, the task offloading decisions, and computation frequency allocation were jointly optimized to minimize the computation delay. In [19], a joint user association, power control, and computation capacity allocation optimization problem was investigated, aiming at minimizing the total energy consumption in a UAV-assisted MEC network,.

The aforementioned works considering the UAV-enabled MEC networks [15], [16], [17], [18], [19] mainly focused on task offloading optimization in the UAV networks. Service placement in the UAV networks has so far drawn little attention. Perhaps the most related work is that of [20]. In [20], the service placement and computation offloading decisions were jointly optimized in the UAV networks, considering different time scales between the service placement decision and the computation offloading decision. A common assumption in these works (i.e., [15], [16], [17], [18], [19], [20]) is that the UEs have the same type of request (request the contents, or the service & task offloading). This assumption, however, is less likely to be valid in realworld implementations. In fact, in practice, the UEs may have heterogeneous requests, such as the content requests and the service requests. For example, in applications such as MECenabled VR/AR [21] and three-dimensional (3D) simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) [22], the UEs need to obtain the contents from the MEC server and require computation services for data processing as well. In such cases, the existing schemes focusing on fulfilling the single type of requests become less applicable. Therefore, it is significant to develop novel schemes for UAV-enabled MEC networks with the UEs of heterogeneous service requests.

Inspired by the above observations, in this paper, we consider a UAV-enabled MEC network, in which multiple UAVs of caching and computation capabilities are deployed to provide communication and computation services for the UEs of heterogeneous content and service requests. In order to advance the understanding of caching and computation offloading in such systems, we address three fundamental questions in this paper, as follows.

1) âHow to support the UEsâ heterogeneous content and service requests in the UAV-enabled MEC systems?â To tackle this question, we establish a framework for supporting the heterogeneous content and service requests from the UEs. In this framework, contents and services are cached a priori at the UAVs with limited storage and computation resources. As such, the UEs of content requests can obtain the required contents by accessing to corresponding feasible UAVs, while the UEs of service requests can either offload the computation tasks to the feasible UAVs or process the tasks locally.

2) âHow to characterize the performance of the UAVenabled MEC systems in satisfying the UEsâ heterogeneous content and service requests?â To address this question, we define the weighted sum of the content cache hit ratio and the service delay shrinkage ratio as the average QoE of our considered network and adopt it as the performance metric. Note that the average QoE allows us for simultaneously characterizing the capability of our network in satisfying the UEsâ heterogeneous content and service requests. Moreover, through analysis, we reveal that the average QoE is determined by the content cache and service placement decisions at the UAVs, as well as the task offloading decisions at the UEs.

3) âHow to improve the average QoE of the UAV-enabled MEC systems?â To answer this question, we formulate an average QoE maximization problem, subject to practical constraints on the UAVsâ caching and computation capabilities. To solve this non-convex problem, we decompose it into two sub-problems, namely, the content cache and service placement optimization sub-problem and the task offloading optimization subproblem. Gibbs sampling-based and matching gamebased algorithms are designed to solve these two subproblems efficiently. Via numerical results, we verify the effectiveness of our proposed algorithms through comparisons with various benchmarks, and show that our algorithms can achieve almost the same average QoE as an upper bound obtained from exhaustive search, especially when the caching and computation resources at the UAVs are limited.

The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Section II presents the system model and formulates the considered problem. Section III proposes the joint content cache, service placement, and task offloading design. In Section VI, numerical results are provided. Finally, Section V draws the conclusion. Unless otherwise specified, the notations used throughout this paper is listed in Table I.

## II. SYSTEM MODEL AND PROBLEM FORMULATION

## A. Network Model

We consider a UAV-enabled MEC network, as shown in Fig. 1, in which multiple UAVs, serving as base stations (BSs), provide communication and computation services for the ground UEs. The set of the UAVs and the set of the ground UEs are denoted by $\mathcal { U } = \{ 1 , 2 , \dots , U \}$ and $\mathcal { M } =$ $\{ 1 , 2 , \ldots , M \}$ , respectively. We consider that a specific UE m can generate two types of request, namely, content request and service request. Specifically, the content request represents that UE m needs certain files, while the service request represents that UE m has certain computation tasks to be completed using specific applications. Due to the limited storage and computation capabilities, for the content request, we consider that UE m needs to obtain the required files from the UAVs that are within its communication range and have the required contents cached a priori. While for the service request, UE m can choose to either compute the tasks locally or offload to the UAVs that are within its communication range and have the services deployed a priori. We note that UE m can obtain a required content from a single UAV only, while it can offload its computation tasks to multiple UAVs that have the service. We also note that each UAV can provide content and computation services for multiple UEs simultaneously. In addition, we consider that each UAV-UE pair is assigned to distinct subchannel for establishing the corresponding downlink and uplink. This setup eliminates co-channel interference during communication, and channel allocation issues are not addressed in this paper. Moreover, we consider a maximum coverage for the UAVs, and denote the wireless coverage information of all the UAV-UE pairs by the matrix $\textbf { \em A } = \ \left[ \mu _ { m , u } \right] _ { M \times U }$ , where $\mu _ { m , u }$ is a binary variable. If $\mu _ { m , u } ~ = ~ 1$ , UE m is within the coverage of UAV u. Otherwise, UE m is beyond the coverage of UAV u. We assume that the coverage information A is known to all the UEs.

Fig. 1. Illustration of our considered UAV-enabled MEC networks, in which the UEs are of heterogeneous content and service requests. Here, A represents the content cached at the UAVs, while B, C, and D represent different services placed at the UAVs.

## B. Cache Model

In this subsection, we detail the cache model of the UAVs. We denote the set of contents, the size of each content, the set of services, and the size of each service by ${ \mathcal { F } } =$ $\{ 1 , 2 , \ldots , F \} , c _ { f } , \mathcal { K } = \{ 1 , 2 , \ldots , K \}$ and $c _ { k } ,$ , respectively. In practice, different contents can correspond to different popular music/videos, while different services correspond to different applications (and the related libraries/databases), such as VR/AR and mobile gaming. As such, a content (service) differs from the other contents (services) by the type and the size. We consider that UAV u has a storage capacity, denoted by $\mathbf { S t } _ { u } , ~ u ~ \in ~ \mathcal { U } .$ As such, before providing communication and computation services, UAV u needs to judiciously select its cached contents and services in order to maximize the performance of the considered network. That is, the following storage constraint should be satisfied for UAV u, given by

<!-- image-->  
Fig. 2. Illustration of request model in our considered network.

$$
\sum _ { f = 1 } ^ { F } x _ { u , f } c _ { f } + \sum _ { k = 1 } ^ { K } x _ { u , k } c _ { k } \leq \mathrm { S t } _ { u } , \ \forall u \in \mathcal { U } ,\tag{1}
$$

where $x _ { u , f }$ and $x _ { u , k }$ are binary variables. $x _ { u , f } = 1 ( x _ { u , k } = 1 )$ denotes that the content f (the service k) is cached at UAV u. Otherwise, the content $f$ (the service k) is not cached at UAV u.

## C. Request Model

In this subsection, we present the request model of our considered network, as illustrated in Fig. 2. Specifically, we denote $\psi _ { m }$ as the request generated by UE m. We consider that $\psi _ { m }$ can either be a content request or a service request. Denote $g _ { m , f } ~ \in ~ \{ 0 , 1 \} ~ ( \ g _ { m , k } ~ \in ~ \{ 0 , 1 \} )$ as the indicator of whether content f (service k) is requested by UE $m ,$ we express the constraint on UE mâs request as

$$
\sum _ { f = 1 } ^ { F } g _ { m , f } q _ { m } + \sum _ { k = 1 } ^ { K } g _ { m , k } ( 1 - q _ { m } ) \leq 1 , \forall m \in \mathcal { M } ,\tag{2}
$$

where $q _ { m } \in \{ 0 , 1 \}$ denotes the indicator of the request type. If $q _ { m } = 1$ , Ïm is a content request. Otherwise, $\psi _ { m }$ is a service request.

Next, we present the process of handling the UEsâ requests. 1) Content Request: For the case where $\psi _ { m }$ is a content request, i.e., $q _ { m } = 1$ , request $\psi _ { m }$ is satisfied when UE m can download the request content f from a specific UAV u that has content f in its cache. Meanwhile, UE m needs to be within the coverage of UAV $u ,$ i.e. $x _ { u , f } = 1$ and $\mu _ { m , u } = 1$ Otherwise, request $\psi _ { m }$ is not satisfied.

2) Service Request: When $\psi _ { m } ^ { k }$ is a service request, i.e., $q _ { m } = 0$ , in order to satisfy request $\psi _ { m } ^ { k }$ , several independent tasks need to be completed. For instance, $\psi _ { m } ^ { k }$ can be a request for VR service from UE m. As such, multiple independent computation tasks (e.g., image processing, tracking, and alignment) need to be completed for providing immersive experience to UE m [23]. We further represent ${ \psi } _ { m } ^ { k }$ using a parameter tuple, given by $\psi _ { m } ^ { k } ~ = ~ \left. \nu _ { m } ^ { k } , \zeta _ { m } ^ { k } , \pmb { \xi } _ { m } ^ { k } \right.$ , where $\mathcal { V } _ { m } ^ { k } ~ = ~ \{ 1 , 2 , . . . , V _ { m , N } ^ { k } \}$ denotes the set of computation tasks required for completing $\psi _ { m }$ using the k-th service, $\zeta _ { m } ^ { k } = \{ \bar { 1 } , 2 , . . . , \zeta _ { m , N } ^ { k } \}$ denotes the set of the total number of instructions (in CPU cycles) needed to complete tasks in $\gamma _ { m } ^ { k }$ , and $\pmb { \xi } _ { m } ^ { k } = \{ 1 , 2 , \dots , \overset { \cdot } { \xi } _ { m , N } ^ { k } \}$ denotes the set of task data sizes (in bits).

We consider that request $\psi _ { m } ^ { k }$ is satisfied when all the computation tasks in $\gamma _ { m } ^ { k }$ are completed. Denote $v _ { m , n } ^ { k } \in \mathcal { V } _ { m } ^ { k }$ as a task n in $\gamma _ { m } ^ { k }$ , UE m can choose either compute it locally or offload it to its associated UAV that cached the k-th service.1 We note that UE m can offload the computation tasks to multiple UAVs when these UAVs are accessible and deployed with the k-th service, i.e., $x _ { u , k } = 1$ and $\mu _ { m , u } = 1$

We use $y _ { m , n , u } ^ { k } ~ \in ~ \{ 0 , 1 \}$ to represent whether the computation task $v _ { m , n } ^ { k }$ is offloaded to UAV u. As such, we have

$$
\sum _ { u = 1 } ^ { U } y _ { m , n , u } ^ { k } \leq 1 , \forall v _ { m , n } ^ { k } \in \mathcal { V } _ { m } ^ { k } .\tag{3}
$$

Note that $\begin{array} { r } { \sum _ { u = 1 } ^ { U } { y _ { m , n , u } ^ { k } } \ = \ 0 } \end{array}$ indicates that task $v _ { m , n } ^ { k }$ is computed locally at UE m.

For UAV $u ,$ it can provide computation services to multiple tasks satisfying the constraint on its computation capability, represented by the number of CPU cores, i.e., $C o r e _ { u } .$ Mathematically, this constraint can be expressed as

$$
\sum _ { m = 1 } ^ { M } \sum _ { k = 1 } ^ { K } \sum _ { n = 1 } ^ { N } y _ { m , n , u } ^ { k } \leq C o r e _ { u } , \ \forall u \in \mathcal { U } .\tag{4}
$$

## D. Performance Metrics

In this subsection, we present the performance metrics adopted in this work. Specifically, we use the content cache hit ratio to evaluate the effectiveness of our considered UAVenabled MEC network in satisfying the UEsâ content requests. The content cache hit ratio is defined as the ratio between the number of successfully responded content requests and the total number of content requests from all the UEs, given a content cache decision $\boldsymbol { X } _ { \mathcal { F } } = [ x _ { u , f } ] _ { U \times F }$ . Mathematically, the content cache hit ratio can be expressed as [24]

$$
\begin{array} { r l } & { \operatorname* { P r } _ { \mathrm { h } } ( X _ { \mathcal { F } } ) } \\ & { \ = \frac { \sum _ { m = 1 } ^ { M } \operatorname* { m i n } \{ 1 , \sum _ { u = 1 } ^ { U } \sum _ { f = 1 } ^ { F } \mu _ { m , u } q _ { m } g _ { m , f } x _ { u , f } \} } { \sum _ { m = 1 } ^ { M } q _ { m } } , } \end{array}\tag{5}
$$

where min $\begin{array} { r l r } { \{ 1 , \sum _ { u = 1 } ^ { U } \sum _ { f = 1 } ^ { F } \mu _ { m , u } q _ { m } g _ { m , f } x _ { u , f } \} } & { { } \in } & { \{ 0 , 1 \} } \end{array}$ indicates whether the content request from UE m can be successfully responded by at least one UAV. Note that, since the denominator cannot be zero, we assume that at least one UE has the content request, i.e., $\textstyle \sum _ { m = 1 } ^ { M } q _ { m } \geq 1$

Next, we focus on evaluating the effectiveness of our considered UAV-enabled MEC network in satisfying the UEsâ service requests. To this end, we define the total delay of completing request $\psi _ { m } ^ { k }$ as the maximum delay among the total delay of completing the tasks in request $\psi _ { m } ^ { k } ,$ , given by

$$
T _ { m } = \operatorname* { m a x } _ { n } t _ { m , n } , \forall v _ { m , n } ^ { k } \in \mathcal { V } _ { m } ^ { k } ,\tag{6}
$$

where $t _ { m , n }$ denotes the total delay of completing task $v _ { m , n } ^ { k }$ in request $\psi _ { m } ^ { k }$ , given by

$$
t _ { m , n } = d _ { m , n } ^ { \mathrm { u l } } + d _ { m , n } ^ { \mathrm { p r } } + d _ { m , n } ^ { \mathrm { d l } } .\tag{7}
$$

In (8), $d _ { m , n } ^ { \mathrm { u l } } , d _ { m , n } ^ { \mathrm { p r } } .$ , and $d _ { m , n } ^ { \mathrm { d l } }$ represent the uplink transmission delay of task $v _ { m , n } ^ { k } ,$ the processing delay of task $v _ { m , n } ^ { k } .$ , and the downlink transmission time of the processing result of task $v _ { m , n } ^ { k }$ , respectively. Due to that the size of the processing result is in general much smaller than the size of the task, we ignore $d _ { m , n } ^ { \mathrm { d l } }$ in $t _ { m , n }$ (as in [14]). As such, $t _ { m , n }$ can be re-expressed as

$$
t _ { m , n } = d _ { m , n } ^ { \mathrm { u l } } + d _ { m , n } ^ { \mathrm { p r } } .\tag{8}
$$

Then, we express the uplink transmission time of task $v _ { m , n } ^ { k } ,$ i.e., $d _ { m , n } ^ { \mathrm { u l } } ,$ as

$$
\begin{array} { r l } {  { d _ { m , n } ^ { \mathrm { u l } } } } \\ & { = \{ \begin{array} { l l } { \displaystyle \sum _ { u = 1 } ^ { U } y _ { m , n , u } \frac { \xi _ { m , n } ^ { k } } { r _ { m , u } } , } & { \mathrm { i f } \sum _ { u = 1 } ^ { U } y _ { m , n , u } = 1 , } \\ { \displaystyle 0 , } & { \mathrm { o t h e r w i s e } . } \end{array}  } \end{array}\tag{9}
$$

In (9), $d _ { m , n } ^ { \mathrm { u l } } = 0$ when UE m processes task $v _ { m , n } ^ { k }$ locally. In addition, $r _ { m , u }$ denotes the uplink transmission rate from UE m to UAV u, given by

$$
r _ { m , u } = W \log _ { 2 } \left( 1 + \gamma _ { m , u } \right) .\tag{10}
$$

In (10), W represents the bandwidth allocated to the subchannel between UE m and UAV u, and $\begin{array} { r } { \gamma _ { m , u } = \frac { P _ { m } d _ { m , u } ^ { - \eta } } { \sigma _ { 0 } ^ { 2 } } } \end{array}$ represents the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of the subchannel between UE m and UAV $u . ^ { 2 }$ Here, $P _ { m } , d _ { m , u } , \eta ,$ and $\sigma _ { 0 } ^ { 2 }$ denote the transmit power of UE m, the distance between UE m and UAV u, the path loss exponent, and the thermal noise power, respectively.

We then express the processing delay of task $v _ { m , n } ^ { k }$ as

$$
\begin{array} { r l } {  { d _ { m , n } ^ { \mathrm { p r } } } } \\ & { = \{ \begin{array} { l l } { \displaystyle \sum _ { u = 1 } ^ { U } y _ { m , n , u } \frac { \zeta _ { m , n } ^ { k } } { f _ { u } } , } & { \mathrm { i f } \sum _ { u = 1 } ^ { U } y _ { m , n , u } = 1 , \medskip } \\ { \displaystyle \frac { \zeta _ { m , n } ^ { k } } { f _ { m } } , } & { \mathrm { o t h e r w i s e } , } \end{array}  } \end{array}\tag{11}
$$

where $f _ { u }$ and $f _ { m }$ denote the maximum CPU frequency of UAV u and that of UE m, respectively.

Based on (6)â(11), we adopt the service delay shrinkage ratio as the performance metric to evaluate the effectiveness of our considered UAV-enabled MEC network in satisfying

the UEsâ service requests, expressed as

$$
\operatorname* { P r } _ { \boldsymbol { \mathrm { s } } } ( \boldsymbol { X } _ { \mathcal { F } } , \boldsymbol { X } _ { \mathcal { K } } , \boldsymbol { Y } ) = \frac { 1 } { M } \sum _ { m = 1 } ^ { M } ( 1 - \frac { T _ { m } } { T _ { m , \mathrm { L } } } ) ,\tag{12}
$$

where $\begin{array} { r c l } { X _ { \mathcal { K } } } & { = } & { [ x _ { u , k } ] _ { U \times K } } \end{array}$ denotes the service placement decision, $\pmb { Y } = [ y _ { m , n , u } ]$ MÃNÃU denotes the task offloading decision of the UEs, $\begin{array} { r } { \dot { T } _ { m , \mathrm { L } } = \sum _ { n = 1 } ^ { N } \zeta _ { m , n } ^ { k } / f _ { m } } \end{array}$ represents the total delay of request $\psi _ { m } ^ { k }$ if all the tasks are processed locally. We note that the service delay shrinkage ratio in (12) is a suitable performance metric for our considered network, since it quantifies the delay performance improvement by employing the service placement decisions at the UAVs and task offloading decisions for the UEs.

Moreover, we consider an energy consumption constraint on UAV u for processing the service requests from the UEs, expressed as

$$
E _ { u } ^ { \mathrm { p r } } \leq E _ { \mathrm { m a x } } , \forall u \in \mathcal { U } ,\tag{13}
$$

where $E _ { \mathrm { m a x } }$ denotes UAV uâs energy capacity for computation, and $E _ { u } ^ { \mathrm { p r } }$ denotes UAV uâs energy consumption for computation, given by [20]

$$
E _ { u } ^ { \mathrm { p r } } = \kappa _ { u } \sum _ { m = 1 } ^ { M } \sum _ { n = 1 } ^ { N } y _ { m , n , u } \zeta _ { m , n } ^ { k } .\tag{14}
$$

In (14), $\kappa _ { u }$ is the unit energy consumption when UAV u processes the tasks with CPU core frequency $f _ { u }$ , and $\begin{array} { r } { \sum _ { m } ^ { \bar { M } } \sum _ { n } ^ { | \nu _ { m } | } y _ { m , n , u } \zeta _ { m , n } ^ { k } } \end{array}$ is the total number of CPU cycles required for processing the tasks at UAV u.

In our considered networks, both content requests and service requests from the UEs need to be satisfied. In order to comprehensively characterize the UEsâ level of satisfaction on the services provided by the UAVs, we develop a novel performance metric, termed as the average QoE of the UEs. In particular, the average QoE of the UEs is defined as the weighted sum of the content cache hit ratio and the service delay shrinkage ratio of service placement, given by

$$
\begin{array} { r l } & { Q \left( \boldsymbol { X } _ { \mathcal { F } } , \boldsymbol { X } _ { K } , \boldsymbol { Y } \right) } \\ & { \ = \alpha \mathrm { P r } _ { \mathrm { h } } \left( \boldsymbol { X } _ { \mathcal { F } } \right) + ( 1 - \alpha ) \mathrm { P r } _ { \mathrm { s } } \left( \boldsymbol { X } _ { \mathcal { F } } , \boldsymbol { X } _ { K } , \boldsymbol { Y } \right) , } \end{array}\tag{15}
$$

where $\alpha ~ \in ~ [ 0 , 1 ]$ denotes the weight of the content cache hit ratio. Note that the average QoE of the UEs in (15) is a general performance metric, since it can evaluate the performance of the networks with both content requests and service requests. By tuning the value of Î±, we can adjust the impacts of the content cache decision, the service placement decision, and the task offloading decision on $Q \left( X _ { \mathcal { F } } , X _ { \mathcal { K } } , Y \right)$ . Note also, the average QoE quantifies the ratio of the actual average performance that a network provides for satisfying the UEsâ heterogeneous content and service requests to the networkâs capacity of satisfying such requests. More specifically, if $Q \left( { \cal X } _ { \mathcal { F } } , { \cal X } _ { \kappa } , { \cal Y } \right) \ = \ 0$ , it means that $\mathrm { P r } _ { \mathrm { h } } \left( \mathbf { X } _ { \mathcal { F } } \right) ~ = ~ 0$ and $\mathrm { P r } _ { \mathrm { h } } \left( \mathbf { X } _ { \mathcal { F } } , \mathbf { X } _ { \mathcal { K } } , \mathbf { Y } \right) \ = \ 0$ , indicating that all the requested contents and services are not deployed at the UAVs. If $Q \left( { \pmb X } _ { \mathcal { F } } , { \pmb X } _ { \kappa } , { \pmb Y } \right) \ = \ \mathrm { ~ 1 ~ }$ , it means that $\mathrm { P r } _ { \mathrm { h } } \left( \mathbf { X } _ { \mathcal { F } } \right) = 1$ and $\mathrm { P r } _ { \mathrm { h } } \left( \mathbf { X } _ { \mathcal { F } } , \mathbf { X } _ { \mathcal { K } } , \mathbf { Y } \right) = 1$ , implying that all the requested contents are deployed at the feasible UAVs and the requested service can be satisfied with no delay. This case of $Q \left( X _ { \mathcal { F } } , X _ { \mathcal { K } } , Y \right) = 1$ can be regarded as an upper bound on our considered networkâs capability of satisfying the UEsâ heterogeneous content and service requests.

## E. Problem Formulation

The goal of our work is to optimize the content cache and service placement decisions of the UAVs, as well as the task offloading decisions of the UEs, such that the average QoE of the UEs is maximized, while simultaneously satisfying practical constraints on the UAVsâ storage capacity, computation capacity, and the energy consumption.3 Our goal is mathematically formulated as

$$
\mathbf { P 1 } \colon \operatorname* { m a x } _ { x _ { \mathcal { F } } , x _ { \mathcal { K } } , Y } Q \left( X _ { \mathcal { F } } , X _ { \mathcal { K } } , Y \right)\tag{16}
$$

$$
\mathbf { s . t . } \quad q _ { m } \in \left\{ 0 , 1 \right\} , \forall m \in \mathcal { M } ,\tag{16a}
$$

$$
\sum _ { f = 1 } ^ { F } g _ { m , f } q _ { m } + \sum _ { k = 1 } ^ { K } g _ { m , k } ( 1 - q _ { m } ) \leq 1 ,
$$

$$
\forall m \in { \mathcal { M } } ,\tag{16b}
$$

$$
\sum _ { f = 1 } ^ { F } x _ { u , f } c _ { f } + \sum _ { k = 1 } ^ { K } x _ { u , k } c _ { k } \leq \mathrm { S t } _ { u } , \ \forall u \in \mathcal { U } ,\tag{16c}
$$

$$
\sum _ { u = 1 } ^ { U } y _ { m , n , u } ^ { k } \leq 1 , \forall v _ { m , n } ^ { k } \in \mathcal { V } _ { m } ,\tag{16d}
$$

$$
\sum _ { m = 1 } ^ { M } \sum _ { k = 1 } ^ { K } \sum _ { n = 1 } ^ { N } y _ { m , n , u } ^ { k } \leq C o r e _ { u } , \ \forall u \in \mathcal { U } ,\tag{16e}
$$

$$
E _ { u } ^ { \mathrm { p r } } \leq E _ { \mathrm { m a x } } , \ \forall u \in \mathcal { U } .\tag{16f}
$$

In (16), constraint (16a) specifies whether a request is a content request or a service request. Constraint (16b) restricts that UE m can generate at most one content request or one service request. Constraint (16c) imposes the storage capacity constraint on UAV $u . ^ { 4 }$ Constraint (16d) indicates that each task in a service request can be processed either locally or offloaded to at most one UAV. Constraint (16e) represents that the number of tasks processed simultaneously by a UAV cannot exceed its number of CPU cores.5 Finally, constraint (16f)

imposes the computation energy consumption constraint on each UAV.

We note that Problem P1 in (16) is mathematically intractable, due to the coupled content cache, service placement, and task offloading variables in the objective function and non-convex constraints. Traditionally, this problem is solved using the exhaustive search method, which can be computation- and time-consuming, especially when the scale of the network, the number of contents, and the number of services become relatively large. To resolve this issue, we propose simple-yet-efficient design that can judiciously determine the content cache and service placement decisions at the UAVs, as well as the task offloading decision at the UEs. The details of our proposed design will be presented in Section III.

## III. PROPOSED JOINT CONTENT CACHING, SERVICE PLACEMENT AND TASK OFFLOADING DESIGN

In this section, we propose a novel design that solves P1 in (16). Specifically, we first decompose P1 into two subproblems, namely, a content cache and service placement decision optimization sub-problem and a task offloading decision sub-problem. Then, we propose novel Gibbs sampling-based and matching-based algorithms that iteratively solve the caching decision optimization sub-problem and the task offloading decision sub-problem, respectively.

## A. Content Caching and Service Placement Decision Optimization Sub-Problem

We first focus on the caching decision optimization subproblem for a given task offloading decision $\bar { Y }$ . To this end, we re-express P1 for a given $\bar { \mathbf { Y } }$ as

$$
\begin{array} { r l } { \mathbf { P 2 } \colon } & { \underset { X _ { \mathcal { F } } , X _ { \mathcal { K } } } { \operatorname* { m a x } } Q \left( X _ { \mathcal { F } } , X _ { \mathcal { K } } , \bar { Y } \right) } \\ & { \mathrm { s . t . } \quad ( 1 6 a ) , ( 1 6 b ) , ( 1 6 c ) . } \end{array}\tag{17}
$$

We note that Problem P2 in (17) is still a mixed integer linear programming problem. Solving such a problem is computationally challenging if employing traditional centralized methods, e.g., generalized Benders decomposition [25] and Lagrangian decomposition [26]. To address this issue, we propose a Gibbs sampling-based algorithm [27], which works in a decentralized and low-complexity manner.

In our proposed Gibbs sampling-based algorithm, we consider the UAVs providing contents and services as an undirected graph, denoted by G. In G, UAV u and UAV $u ^ { \prime }$ is connected by an edge if there exist common UEs within their corresponding coverage. Then, the undirected graph G may be partitioned into multiple connected subgraphs based on the information of edges between all the UAVs. The decision changes of UAV u may have an impact on the decisions of all the other UAVs belonging to the same connected subgraph as u.

We denote the content cache and service placement decisions of UAV u as $\begin{array} { r l r } { { \pmb x } _ { u } } & { { } = } & { \left( { \pmb x } _ { u , f } , { \pmb x } _ { u , k } \right) } \end{array}$ , where $\begin{array} { r l r } { \mathbf { x } _ { u , f } } & { { } \ } & { = { } \ \quad ( x _ { u , 1 } , \ x _ { u , 2 } , \ \ldots , \ x _ { u , F } ) } \end{array}$ and $\begin{array} { r l r l } { \pmb { x } _ { u , k } } & { { } } & { = } \end{array}$ $( x _ { u , 1 } , \ x _ { u , 2 } , \ . \ . . , \ x _ { u , K } )$ . Then, we define all the possible values of the decision vector $\mathbf { \boldsymbol { x } } _ { u }$ satisfying (16c) as the feasible decision space of content cache and service placement of UAV $u ,$ denoted by $\begin{array} { r } { \mathcal { X } _ { u } ~ = ~ \{ \pmb { x } _ { u } \vert \sum _ { f = 1 } ^ { F } x _ { u , f } c _ { f } \} \overset { \cdot } { + } \sum _ { k = 1 } ^ { K } x _ { u , k } c _ { k } ~ \leq } \end{array}$ $\mathrm { S t } _ { u } \}$ . Then, the feasible decision space of content cache and service placement for all the UAVs can be represented by $\pmb { \chi } = \{ \mathcal { X } _ { 1 } , \mathcal { X } _ { 2 } , \ldots , \mathcal { X } _ { U } \}$ . We express the joint posterior distribution of decision updating at UAV u as [14]

$$
\operatorname* { P r } ( \pmb { x } _ { u }  \tilde { \pmb { x } } _ { u } ) = [ 1 + \exp [ \frac { Q ( \pmb { x } _ { u } ) - Q ( \tilde { \pmb { x } } _ { u } ) } { \tau } ] ] ^ { - 1 } ,\tag{18}
$$

where $\tau$ is a smoothing factor $( \tau ~ > ~ 0 )$ used to balance exploration and exploitation (i.e., the randomness of content cache and service placement decision updates).

Using (15) and (18), our Gibbs sampling-based algorithm can be applied for content cache and service placement decision optimization, the details of which will be presented at the end of Section III-B.

## B. Task Offloading Decision Optimization Sub-Problem

Next, we focus on the task offloading decision optimization sub-problem for given $\bar { X } _ { \mathcal { F } }$ and $\bar { X } _ { \kappa }$ . In this case, Problem P1 in (16) can be expressed as

$$
\begin{array} { r l } { \mathbf { P 3 } : } & { \underset { \mathbf { Y } } { \operatorname* { m a x } } Q \left( \bar { X } _ { \mathcal { F } } , \bar { X } _ { \mathcal { K } } , Y \right) } \\ & { \mathbf { s . t . } \quad ( 1 6 d ) , ( 1 6 e ) , ( 1 6 f ) . } \end{array}\tag{19}
$$

In order to solve P3 in (19), we model it as a constrained many-to-one matching game [28]. Specifically, we denote the computation tasks of the UEsâ service requests by V. Then, we can model the task offloading decision optimization subproblem as a bidirectional matching process between V and the set of UAVs, i.e., U .

To this end, we construct a bipartite graph based on sets V and U. In this graph, an edge connects a node $v \in \mathcal V$ and a node $u \in \mathcal { U }$ if and only if UAV u has a service placed for task $v ,$ and the UE that generates task v is within the coverage of UAV u. That is, node $i \in \{ u , v \}$ , can only select a matching partner from its neighboring node set $\mathcal { N } _ { j } , j \in \{ u , v \} , j \neq i .$

Then, we define L as a matching function, satisfying the following conditions:

1) $L \left( v \right) \subseteq \mathcal { N } _ { v } L \left( u \right) \subseteq \mathcal { N } _ { u } ,$

2) $| L \left( v \right) | \leq 1 ,$

3) $\begin{array} { r } { | L \left( u \right) | \leq C o r e _ { u } , } \end{array}$

4) L (v) = u if and only ${ \mathrm { i f ~ } } v \in L ( u )$

Condition 1) implies that a specific task can only be matched with the UAVs, and a specific UAV can only be matched with the tasks; Condition 2) and 3) represent that each task v can be matched with at most one UAV, and the number of tasks matched with the same UAV u is limited by its number of computational unit core count $C o r e _ { u } ,$ respectively; Condition 4) indicates that if task v is matched with UAV u, then UAV u is also matched with task $v ,$ and vice versa.

After constructing the bipartite graph, we initialize the matching process according to the matching function L. This initialization can be efficiently implemented using the Hungarian algorithm [29] in polynomial time. Then, we construct a preference list for each task, denoted by $\mathcal { C P } _ { v } .$

Specifically, we express the total delay of completing task v offloaded to UAV u as $D _ { v } ( u ) \ = \ t _ { m , n }$ when $v \ = \ v _ { m , n } .$ As such, if $D _ { v } ( u ) < D _ { v } ( u ^ { \prime } )$ , task v prefers to being offloaded to UAV $u ^ { \prime }$ over UAV u. Similarly, we construct a preference list for each UAV, denoted by $\mathcal { S P } _ { u } .$ . We also denote the set of tasks matched with UAV u by $\mathcal { T } _ { u }$ . Then, the total delay of completing all the tasks offloaded to UAV u as $D _ { u } ( T _ { u } ) = \operatorname* { m a x } _ { v \in T _ { u } } D _ { v } ( u )$ . If $D _ { u } ( T _ { u } ) \ < \ D _ { u } ( T _ { u } ^ { \prime } )$ , UAV u prefers to being matching with the tasks $\mathcal { T } _ { u }$ over $\mathcal { T } _ { u } ^ { \prime }$

According to the preference lists of tasks and UAVs, we can complete the matching games as follows. First, each task chooses its corresponding most preferred UAV based on its preference list. If the chosen UAV can process this task, it will be added to the UAVâs match task set (we term this operation as matching transfer). Otherwise, this task fails to be matched in this round. Second, the tasks perform the swap operations, defined as

$$
\begin{array} { r } { L _ { v } ^ { v ^ { \prime } } = \left\{ L - \left\{ \left( v , L \left( v \right) \right) , \left( v ^ { \prime } , L \left( v ^ { \prime } \right) \right) \right\} \right\} } \\ { \cup \left\{ \left( v , L \left( v ^ { \prime } \right) \right) , \left( v ^ { \prime } , L \left( v \right) \right) \right\} , } \end{array}\tag{20}
$$

where $\langle v , v ^ { \prime } \rangle$ is a feasible swap-pair, satisfying the following conditions:

$$
\begin{array} { r l } & { 1 ) \displaystyle \operatorname* { m a x } _ { b _ { p } = b _ { q } } D _ { q } \left( L _ { v } ^ { v ^ { \prime } } \right) \geq \displaystyle \operatorname* { m a x } _ { b _ { p } = b _ { q } } D _ { q } \left( L \right) \mathrm { , ~ } \forall p \in \{ v , v ^ { \prime } \} , } \\ & { 2 ) \displaystyle \operatorname* { m a x } _ { b _ { p } = b _ { q } } D _ { q } \left( L _ { v } ^ { v ^ { \prime } } \right) > \displaystyle \operatorname* { m a x } _ { b _ { p } = b _ { q } } D _ { q } \left( L \right) \mathrm { , ~ } \exists p \in \{ v , v ^ { \prime } \} . } \end{array}
$$

where $b _ { q }$ represents the index of service request that the task $q \in \mathcal V$ belonging to. In the swap operations, the matched UAVs of two tasks swap to reduce the total delay of satisfying the service requests. The swap operations stop until the entire matching process reaches a stable state. We note that there may be cases where a task v is not matched with any UAV $( \mathbf { i . e . , \ } L ( v ) = \oslash )$ . In such cases, task v is processed locally. The detailed procedures of our proposed matching game based algorithm for task offloading optimization are summarized in Algorithm 1.

Convergence and complexity analysis of Algorithm 1: We note that Algorithm 1 is guaranteed to converge since it is based on the swap operations. As per the definition of the feasible swap-pair, we can always find a swap operation after which no further swap-pair can be found to reduce the total delay of satisfying a service request (please refer to [30] for more details on how the matching game converges to a two-sided exchange stable matching state).

We note that the computational complexity of Algorithm 1 is mainly from performing the Hungarian algorithm, constructing the preference lists for all the tasks and UAVs, the transfer and swap operations. In the following, we analyze their complexities respectively. The complexity of Hungarian algorithm is O(U V ) [29], since it connects all V tasks and U UAVs in order to construct the bipartite graph. The computational complexity for constructing preference lists for all tasks and UAVs is ${ \mathcal { O } } ( U ^ { 2 } V )$ [31]. Since in Algorithm 1, we set the number of maximum swap operations between a feasible swap pair $\langle v , v ^ { \prime } \rangle$ as 2. As such, the complexity of transfer and swap operations is $\mathcal { O } ( V ^ { 2 } )$ [32]. Based on the above analysis, we note that the complexity of Algorithm 1 is max $\{ \mathcal { O } \dot { ( } U ^ { 2 } V ) , \mathcal { O } \left( V ^ { 2 } \right) \}$

Finally, we present our proposed joint content cache, service placement, and task offloading design, as shown in Algorithm 2. We note that, in Algorithm 2, the Gibbs sampling-based algorithm is embedded. Specifically, the Gibbs sampling-based algorithm randomly selects a UAV u and a new content cache and service placement decision $\tilde { \mathbf { x } } _ { u }$ from $\mathcal { X } _ { u }$ (Step 6-7). After calculating the QoE $Q ( \tilde { X } _ { \mathcal { F } } , \tilde { X } _ { \mathcal { K } } , \bar { Y } )$ (Step 11), the content cache and service placement decision of UAV u, i.e., ${ \mathbf { } } x _ { u } ,$ is updated by $\tilde { \mathbf { \ b { x } } } _ { u }$ with probability Î· and remains unchanged with probability 1âÎ· (Step 12-13). Finally, the updated content cache and service placement decision of UAV u $( \mathrm { i } . \mathrm { e } . , \pmb { x } _ { u } )$ are broadcasted to other UAVs in the connected subgraph of u (Step 14).

Convergence and complexity analysis of Algorithm 2: We note that Algorithm 2 is an iterative algorithm based on Gibbs sampling and Algorithm 1. Specifically, in each iteration, Gibbs sampling is first performed to update the content cache and service placement decisions. Based on these decisions, Algorithm 1 is then executed to determine the task offloading decisions for satisfying the service requests. Due to the fact that both Gibbs sampling and Algorithm 1 are guaranteed to converge (please refer to [13] for more detailed convergence analysis on Gibbs sampling), we note that Algorithm 2 is guaranteed to converge as well. Note also Gibbs sampling is of linear complexity (i.e., O(1)) [13]. As such, the complexity of Algorithm 2 is mainly determined by the number of iterations in Algorithm 2 (denoted by I) and the complexity of Algorithm 1 $( \mathrm { i . e . , m a x } \{ \mathcal { O } ( U ^ { 2 } V ) , \mathcal { O } ( V ^ { 2 } ) \} )$ Then, we can obtain that the complexity of Algorithm 2 is max $\{ \mathcal { O } ( I U ^ { 2 } V ) , \mathcal { O } ( I V ^ { 2 } ) \}$

## IV. NUMERICAL RESULTS

In this section, we provide numerical results to validate the effectiveness of our proposed algorithms. Without loss of generality, we consider a simulating area of 3000 mÃ2000 m, in which 13 UAVs and 63 UEs are deployed, as shown in Fig. 3. The locations of the UAVs and UEs are randomly uniformly generated according to certain point processes. The altitude and coverage radius of the UAVs are set as 450 m. In addition, we consider 6 contents and 2 services. Each UE randomly uniformly requests these contents and services with probability 2/3 and 1/3, respectively. The simulation performances are obtained by averaging over

We first verify the convergence of our proposed algorithm. In this figure, we plot the average QoE achieved by Algorithm 2 versus the number of iterations for different values of Ï . Recall that Ï is a smoothing factor balancing exploration and exploitation of the proposed algorithm. A larger value of Ï indicates that Algorithm 2 tends to explore more, while a smaller value of Ï indicates that Algorithm 2 tends to exploit more. Different values of Ï are selected for comparison purpose, i.e., $\tau \in \{ 5 , 1 0 , 1 0 0 , 2 0 / \ln t \}$ . Note that for the case of $2 0 / \ln t .$ , the value of Ï varies as the number of iterations increases. In addition, we provide an performance upper bound achieved by exhaustive search. We first see that, for different values of Ï , the average QoE achieved by our proposed algorithm converges. We also see that, the performance of our algorithm improves as the value of Ï reduces from 100 to 5. Moreover, we see that with $\tau = 2 0 \ln t ,$ the average QoE achieved by our algorithm can approach the upper bound, indicating that the performance of our algorithm can be significantly improved by judiciously selecting the value of $\tau .$

In Fig. 5, we examine the effectiveness of Algorithm 1. Specifically, we plot the service delay shrinkage ratio (i.e., Prs $( X _ { \mathcal { F } } , X _ { \kappa } , Y ) )$ versus the number of CPU cores per UAV. Two schemes are considered, i.e., Algorithm 1 and the greedy scheme. In the greedy scheme, each UE offloads its tasks to the feasible UAV with optimal computation capabilities and link quality. When multiple tasks conflict with each other, they are randomly selected based on the corresponding UAVâs computing capabilities. The tasks that are not selected will be offloaded to other UAVs. The process stops until all the tasks are either offloaded or processed locally. We observe that the service delay shrinkage ratio achieved by both schemes increases as the number of CPU cores per UAV increases, implying that task offloading can significantly accelerate the completion of the service requests. In addition, we observe that Algorithm 1 achieves a higher service delay shrinkage ratio than the greedy scheme. The performance gap becomes more profound when the number of CPU cores per UAV increases. This observation once again validates that the collaborations among the UAVs can significantly improve the service delay shrinkage ratio, leading to the increase in the average QoE of our considered UAV networks.

Next, we verify the effectiveness of our proposed Algorithm 2 in Fig. 6. In this figure, we compare the average QoE, the content cache hit ratio, and the service delay shrinkage ratio achieved by Algorithm 2 with three benchmark schemes, namely, non-cooperative (NCO) scheme, content-first (CF) scheme, and service-first (SF) scheme, respectively. These benchmark scheme work as follows:

1) NCO scheme: In this scheme, each UAV works independently and does not collaborate with the other UAVs. Specifically, each UAV performs an exhaustive search to go through its every feasible content cache and service placement decision, and then selects the optimal decision that provides the largest average QoE for the UEs within its coverage. Meanwhile, the UEsâ computation tasks are uniformly offloaded to the feasible UAVs.

Fig. 5. Service delay shrinkage ratio versus the number of CPU cores per UAV.

2) CF scheme: In this scheme, the content requests are of higher priorities than the service requests. As such, all the UAVs made their decisions aiming at maximizing the content cache hit ratio of our considered UAV networks.

3) SF scheme: In this scheme, the service requests are of higher priorities than the content requests. As such, all the UAVs made their decisions aiming at optimize the service delay shrinkage ratio of the considered UAV networks.

We see that, compared to NCO scheme, Algorithm 2 achieves almost the same content cache hit ratio, while achieving significant better service delay shrinkage ratio performance, resulting in 30% improvement in terms of the average QoE. This is because, the UAVs collaborate in Algorithm 2 while do not collaborate in NCO scheme. This collaborations among the UAVs significantly improve the service delay shrinkage ratio, while having little impacts on the content cache hit ratio. In particular, the computation tasks for satisfying a service request of UE m can be offloaded to multiple feasible UAVs, while UE m can obtain a requested content from a single UAV only. We also see that, although CF scheme and SF scheme can achieve higher content cache hit ratio and higher service delay shrinkage ratio than Algorithm 2, respectively, their average QoEs are significantly worse than that of our algorithm, indicating that the system performance can be degraded if the UEsâ requests are not properly prioritized.

In Fig. 7, we examine the impacts of storage capacity of UAV (i.e., Stu) on the average QoE achieved by Algorithm 2 and three benchmark schemes. In this figure, we see that the average QoE achieved by four schemes increases as the values of $\mathrm { S t } _ { u } ,$ and Algorithm 2 outperforms three benchmark schemes. We also see that, as the value of $\mathrm { S t } _ { u }$ increases, the average QoE achieved by theses schemes converge to a certain value, showing how our algorithm can be useful when the computation resources at the UAVs are limited.

In Fig. 8, we examine the impacts of energy constraint $E _ { \mathrm { m a x } }$ on the service delay shrinkage ratio for different schemes. In this figure, we observe that $\mathrm { P r } _ { \mathrm { s } } ( X _ { \mathcal { F } } , X _ { \mathcal { K } } , Y )$ increases as the value of $E _ { \mathrm { m a x } }$ , indicating that the service requests from the UEs can be better satisfied the UAVs allocate more energy for computation consumption. In addition, we see that the performance improvement of Algorithm 2 and SF scheme are significant, while that of CF scheme and NCO scheme is less profound. This is due to the fact that CF scheme allocates the service requests with less priorities and NCO scheme does not exploit the collaboration gain among the UAVs. Moreover, we see that the service delay shrinkage ratio achieved by Algorithm 2 is slight lower than that achieved by SF scheme. This is because Algorithm 2 balances between the content cache hit ratio and the service delay shrinkage ratio, while SF scheme priorities the service requests.

Fig. 9. Average QoE versus the number of UEs with the number of UAVs $U = 1 3 , \tau = \tilde { 2 0 } /$ ln t and $\alpha = 0 . 5$

In Fig. 9, we examine how the number of UEs (i.e., M ) impacts the performances of different schemes. Specifically, we plot the average QoE achieved by different schemes versus M ranging from 10 to 60. For a fixed value of M, the locations of UEs are randomly uniformly distributed according to a certain point process. We first observe that the average QoE achieved by all the schemes decreases as M increases. This is because, the number of requests increases as M increases. With limited caching and computation resources of the UAVs, an increased number of UEsâ requests leads to the reduced content cache hit ratio and the service delay shrinkage ratio, which consequently degrade the average QoE. We also observe that, the average QoE achieved by our Algorithm 2 consistently outperforms three benchmark schemes as M increases, confirming once again how the proposed scheme can enhance the capability of our considered systems in satisfying the UEsâ heterogeneous content and service requests.

Finally, in Fig. 10, we examine the impacts of the number of UAVs (i.e., U) on the average QoE achieved by different schemes. Specifically, we divide the simulating area into U grids. Each UAV is randomly deployed within each grid. Note that such deployment strategy of the UAVs is suitable for providing coverage for the randomly uniformly deployed UEs. In this figure, we observe that the average of QoE achieved by different schemes increases with the number of UAVs. This is because the considered system has more caching and computation resources with more UAVs, which in turn improves the capability of our system in satisfying the UEâs requests. We also see that, although Algorithm 2 outperforms other benchmark schemes for different values of U, the average QoE achieved by all the schemes gradually approaches 1 as the value of U becomes relatively large, indicating how the UEsâ requests can be satisfied with perfect experience when our system has sufficient caching and computation resources.

## V. CONCLUSION

In this paper, we considered a UAV-enabled MEC network, in which multiple UAVs with caching and computation capabilities are deployed to satisfy the content and service requests generated by the UEs. We adopted the weighted sum of the content cache ratio and the service delay shrinkage ratio as the performance metric (termed as the average QoE) to evaluate the capability of our considered network in satisfying the UEsâ requests. We proposed simple-yet-efficient algorithms that jointly optimize the content cache and service placement decisions at the UAV, as well as the task offloading decisions at the UEs, such that the average QoE can be maximized. Numerical results verified the effectiveness of our proposed algorithms. Moreover, we show how the average QoE of our considered network can be significantly improved compared to various benchmark schemes, especially when the caching and computation capabilities of the UAVs are constrained.
