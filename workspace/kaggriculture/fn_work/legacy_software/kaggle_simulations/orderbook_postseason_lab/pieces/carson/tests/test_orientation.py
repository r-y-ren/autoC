"""Per-game orientation behavior of the population rollout collector.

The collector flips every row's encoder output into its *game's* frame
before the forward, restripes the oriented movement logits back to real-action
columns for the Rust sampler, and stores the unit factors in oriented space.
Both seats of a game share the frame; games cycle all four symmetries so
every member sees every rendering. These tests pin the contracts that make
the PPO replay path work unchanged: identity is bit-for-bit the
pre-orientation collector, stored factors are the oriented images of the
real sample, and non-convolutional populations are refused rather than
misread.
