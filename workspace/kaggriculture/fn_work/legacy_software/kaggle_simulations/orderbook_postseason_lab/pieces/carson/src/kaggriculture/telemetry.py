#: Bumped whenever the *logic* that places journal fields changes. The layout
#: tables are not covered here; they are fingerprinted into the version below,
#: because a hand-maintained number fails silently -- someone renames a tag,
#: forgets the bump, and every existing mirror keeps serving the old scheme.
#: 4: benchmark mode became four-valued and gained an `audit` kind. The
#: fingerprint below covers the run and tag format strings, not the logic that
#: chooses what to substitute into them, so a mirror written under epoch 3
#: would keep serving `ppo-eager` for runs the new derivation calls
#: `update-only` and go unrebuilt -- exactly the silent failure this number
#: exists to prevent.
#: 5: the collection knob became a mode, so the label names it. The same
#: failure applies with the same force: a run epoch 4 filed as `rollout-only`
#: is now `rollout-cudagraphs-update-eager` or `rollout-inductor-update-eager`,
#: two configurations epoch 4 could not tell apart, and their isolated
#: collection forwards measure 5.309 ms against 2.720 ms.
#: 6: the update knob became a mode too, so the label names it instead of
#: saying `compiled`. Same failure, same force: a run epoch 5 filed as
#: `rollout-inductor-update-compiled` is now one of four labels -- `default`,
#: `reduce-overhead`, `max-autotune`, `max-autotune-no-cudagraphs` -- which
#: epoch 5 could not tell apart, and separating graph capture from benchmarked
#: kernel selection is the entire reason those modes are enumerated separately
#: (`ppo.UPDATE_COMPILE_MODES`).
#: 7: a training mirror is one event file. Cohorts, policy heads and league
#: strata were runs, so mirroring one run wrote ten event files and a parent
#: `--logdir` showed ten selector rows for every run it held; each is now the
#: tag's last segment. This is the epoch's whole purpose in the one case the
#: fingerprint below cannot cover: it hashes the lookup tables, and their values
#: did not change -- only the placement logic reading them did. Without the bump
#: an epoch 6 mirror would be judged current and appended to under the new
#: scheme, serving both layouts from one directory.
#: 8: a population run reports every training category once per agent, plus
#: `population-` categories for the head-to-head score-rate matrix and the
#: pairwise policy disagreement. The per-agent facet is placement logic that no
#: table value expresses: under epoch 7 an `agent0_value_loss` field fell through
#: every rule into `misc/agent0_value_loss`, a tag the new scheme never writes, so
#: an epoch 7 mirror appended to under this one would serve one agent's critic
#: loss from two categories at once.
#: 9: VAPO decoupled GAE adds `schedule/critic_gae_lambda` beside the actor
#: lambda. The fingerprint would already rebuild, but an epoch bump keeps the
#: human ledger in the same file as the tables.
#: 10: actor and critic NextLat predictors gained independent held-out, fitting,
#: gate, and representation-loss categories. Prefix placement is logic as well
#: as data, so the epoch and fingerprint both change.
#: 11: per-head abort thresholds (`*_fatal_at`) are no longer plotted -- they
#: are flat configuration bounds, one chart per head, and the bound they guard
#: keeps its own curve -- and behavior cloning's per-module representation
#: diagnostics moved out of `misc` into `representation-<module>/`. Both are
#: placement logic the table values do not express, so the epoch moves with
#: the fingerprint.
#: 12: NextLat persistence ratios are diagnostics, not predictor-quality gates.
#: 13: per-opponent credit diagnostics are weighted into one opponent cohort
#: per horizon. Opponent checkpoint ids are unbounded, so exposing each as a
#: TensorBoard run creates one six-chart selector row per sampled opponent.
