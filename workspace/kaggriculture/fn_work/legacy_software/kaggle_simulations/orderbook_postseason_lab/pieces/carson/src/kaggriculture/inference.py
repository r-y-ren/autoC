# Version 17 aligns potential/terminal margin and balances main/auxiliary model
# gradients. Old value targets and optimizer moments cannot resume this regime;
# version-16 actors remain usable for inference and fresh initialization.
# Version 16 replaces centered EV with bias-sensitive R-squared in the adaptive
# critic warmup state. Old EV evidence must never release an actor under the
# new gate; legacy actor weights remain exportable without training recovery.
# Version 15 restricts PPO NextLat to normalized actor/value head inputs and
# adds the critic value norm. Version-14 actor weights remain exportable, but
# old critic/predictor/optimizer states cannot resume under the new objective.
# Version 14 makes NextLat joint and ungated and removes predictor gate recovery
# state. Old checkpoints remain exportable as actors, not resumable training.
# Version 13 adds a critic-side structured dynamics predictor and its optimizer
# to full recovery checkpoints. Both dynamics modules remain training-only, so
# actor export can still read version 12 as well as the new format without
# carrying either predictor forward.
#
# Version 12 records each member's `orientation`: the grid symmetry its
# observations were rendered through during training. Acting under anything
# else shows the weights a world they never saw, so evaluation and submission
# replay the recorded code, and resume demands this version rather than
# guessing a rendering the run never used.
#
# Version 11 gave a population run's payload a list of members under `agents`
# in place of the four top-level state dicts a single learner keeps. The bump is
# what stops a version-10 resume from being read as a population of one: the
# resume path reconstructs N actors, critics and optimizer pairs from that list,
# and a payload without it would restore nothing for members 1..N-1 and train
# them from their fresh initialization while reporting a resumed run.
#
# Version 10 renamed the resume payload's `vapo_config` key to `ppo_config`.
# The bump is the whole point of the number: the key has exactly one reader and
# it subscripts, so without it a version-9 checkpoint passes the format check,
# gets its weights, optimizers and every RNG stream restored, and only then
# dies on a bare KeyError with the process already mutated. Version 9 added
# required PFSP league score-rate resume state, the critic_epochs knob, and the
# architecture tag. Resume (training.py) demands the current version exactly;
# actor export stays readable across the legacy versions for weights and model
# configuration, which is what the rename left untouched.
#
# Their calibration provenance is a different matter and is NOT carried across.
# It is versioned separately and independently of the checkpoint format, and
# every superseded version is refused rather than migrated, because each bump
# so far removed a claim the older record could not substantiate: version 1
# held a single `compile_models` whose per-phase meaning the run could not have
# measured, and version 2 held two per-phase speedups differenced across a pair
# of runs that moved both knobs at once, attributing to each knob a change the
# evidence cannot separate. Exporting either would let an artifact assert a
# calibration nobody can recompute, which is the exact failure the version bump
# exists to prevent -- so such a checkpoint is refused at the export boundary
# rather than being migrated or silently stripped.
