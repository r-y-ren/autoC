"""Measure whether the last critic epochs of a PPO update generalize or memorize.

The original schedule measured here ran `epochs=1, critic_epochs=4` at
`minibatch_size=2048`; the critic refit was roughly 26 s of a 33.7 s iteration,
about 6.5 s per critic epoch. The hypothesis under test is that the later epochs
buy nothing the run can use. The run's own telemetry raises it:
`critic_fit_explained_variance_first_epoch` against `_last_epoch` measured
0.906 against 0.987, which is the signature of a
regression that keeps improving on the rollout batch it is being fitted to
rather than on states it has not seen.

Neither of those two numbers can settle it, because both are scored on states
the epoch in question is fitting. This instrument holds states out instead.

The holdout is BY GAME, never by state. States along one trajectory are
strongly correlated, so a random state split puts near-duplicates of fitted
states into the holdout and would report memorization as generalization. Games
are split 80/20 on `episode_seeds` -- both self-play seats of a game share one
seed and therefore land on the same side -- the critic is refitted on the fit
games alone under the measured schedule (same `_stage_tensor` staging, same
`_fixed_minibatch_positions` partitioning, same `make_optimizers` construction
and `_optimizer_step` warmup, same bf16 autocast, same `update_compile_mode`,
same `_critic_minibatch_objective`), and after every epoch
explained variance and the optimized distributional loss are measured on both
sides at frozen weights, with a CUDA-synchronized wall clock around each epoch's
gradient steps. Explained variance uses the same four target/residual moments
and `_fit_explained_variance` definition as run telemetry; the probe computes
those moments outside the timed path.

The curve runs past the production schedule so its shape is measured rather
than extrapolated, and over several repeats with different rollout seeds.
With ``--actor`` those repeats use different fresh critic initializations;
with ``--checkpoint`` they clone the same real critic and optimizer state so
the only between-repeat variation is the rollout and game split.

FALSIFICATION. The hypothesis "later epochs are wasted" is falsified if the
holdout explained variance still gained from epoch 2 onwards -- differenced per
repeat, so each curve is its own control -- exceeds the across-repeat spread of
that same difference: those epochs are then buying generalization and their wall
clock is earned. It is supported if the holdout curve goes flat within that
spread while the fit curve keeps climbing, which is memorization. `decision.rule`
states the exact test, and it is the strict direction of the two available: it
scores the whole remaining gain rather than one epoch at a time, so a run of
small real gains that each hide under the noise still fails it.

Only the critic runs here, and that is exact rather than a simplification: the
actor and critic are separate modules with separate optimizers, the value
targets are fixed before the update begins, and so an actor epoch cannot change
what the critic fits.

The default ``--actor`` mode uses a fresh critic with a zero-initialized value
head. That is the pipeline's starting point, but it is biased towards finding
later epochs useful. ``--warmup-iterations`` fits disjoint waves first to
approach the warm regime. ``--checkpoint`` is the preferred steady-state test:
it restores both critic weights and optimizer moments before every repeat and
does not permit synthetic warmup. A value-fit curve is not end-to-end policy
improvement; the report records that caveat explicitly.

    per-epoch test is not usable as the decision rule at this repeat count: a
    gain that is pure noise exceeds its own three-sample standard deviation
    something like a third of the time, so a single fluke late in the curve would
    veto a plateau the rest of the curve supports. The remaining gain is also
    exactly the quantity the decision spends wall clock on, and it is the
    stricter test of the two, since a run of small real gains sums into it while
    each one alone hides under the noise. Per-epoch marginal gains and their own
    noise flags stay in `per_epoch`, which is where the curve's shape is read.

    Per-epoch seconds are rescaled to the production schedule's minibatch count,
    because this probe fits self-play states minus a holdout while production
    fits a league-mixed wave whole. Steady-state per-minibatch cost is taken as
