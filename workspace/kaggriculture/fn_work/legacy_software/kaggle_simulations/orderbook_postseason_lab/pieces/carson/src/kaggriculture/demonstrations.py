"""Project demonstrated engine actions into exact factored training targets.

The extractor turns a recorded engine action dict (``{"farmer", "hands",
"market"}``) into the factored representation the policy trains on, together
with the same sequential legality masks the sampler would have produced at
that state.

The projection target is the action the engine *executes*, not the bytes the
teacher emitted: the official interpreter ignores arguments beyond each
opcode's arity, clamps pickups to shed stock, silently no-ops commands whose
preconditions fail, fills market orders one unit at a time until resources
run out, and discards zero-fill orders. Each of those reductions is mirrored
here with the engine as the cited authority. Anything else — a state change
the engine would make that our factored space cannot represent, or a command
our legality mask forbids that the engine would execute — raises
:class:`DemonstrationError`. Silent substitution there would bake mask-model
divergence from the engine into the dataset — the highest-value failure mode
this pipeline can detect.
