"""Build a minimal actor-only Kaggriculture submission tarball.

Two independent gates must pass. The provenance gate binds the shipped bytes to
the checkpoint, the run, and the seeds that selected it. The strength gate reads
what the agent actually scored, which the provenance gate cannot see: a report's
`valid_for_selection` means the evaluation itself ran correctly, not that the
agent won anything. Both finalists in `evaluations/` carry `score_rate` 0.0 with
0 wins over 256 seats against `public-v27` and are stamped valid, so provenance
alone has already packaged agents that lose every game they play.
