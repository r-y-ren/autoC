"""Separate "the weights were destroyed" from "sampling breaks the program".

`runs/ppo-bc5mix` warm-starts PPO from a behavior clone that is verified strong
under DETERMINISTIC play (151,799 own money against `starter`, score rate
1.0000), and the run's `money_mean` falls from ~48,000 to ~3,900 within four
iterations of unfreezing the actor. Two incompatible stories fit that journal:

  1. the update destroyed the weights, so the policy no longer knows how to
     farm at all; or
  2. the weights are intact and the *wave* is the casualty -- the rollout is
     collected at temperature 1.0 (pinned by the replay-parity contract in
     `rollout.py`), farming is a long precise multi-step program, and a small
     per-step deviation rate breaks the chain multiplicatively.

The two stories are separated by one measurement: play the same checkpoints on
the same seeds against the same opponent under both decode modes. Argmax money
that stays high while sampled money collapses is story 2; argmax money that
collapses with it is story 1.

Both cells of a checkpoint therefore run identical seeds, opponent and horizon
and differ only in the decode rule, so their difference is attributable to
decode alone. Because the native league seat is `seed % 2`, a contiguous seed
block covers both seats in equal numbers and every cell inherits the same seat
assignment, which keeps the comparison paired across cells rather than merely
matched in aggregate.

Money is reported with the policy's own sharpness on the states each mode
actually visits -- mean entropy per active component, mean probability of the
top action, the realized argmax-agreement rate, and the implied number of
off-argmax components per episode. Entropy alone cannot distinguish a peaked
policy in familiar states from a peaked policy that sampling has walked into
unfamiliar ones; entropy measured separately along each mode's own trajectory
can, and that is the quantity the journal's rising `rollout_entropy` is made of.

Two independent simulators back the argmax numbers. The wave runs in the native
batched Rust engine (`collect_mixed_play_rust`), which is what training uses;
the cross-check replays a handful of games through the official
`kaggle_environments` simulator with the same `CheckpointAgent` the run's own
external evaluator uses, on the same seeds and seats, so its output is directly
comparable to the `external_eval` records in `metrics-external.jsonl`.

CPU-only and single-threaded by default: the model is 1.4M parameters, the
comparison is a handful of waves, and the GPU is not this probe's to take.

    `scripts/evaluate_checkpoint.py` cannot be used here: it calls
    `require_source_identity`, which demands the checkout match the artifact's
    recorded identity exactly, and this tree is deliberately dirty while the
    collapse is being investigated. The parts that decide the number -- a
    deterministic `act_batch` agent and the seed/seat sweep of
    `scripts/external_eval_worker.py` -- are reused as they are, so the result
    is directly comparable to the `external_eval` records the run already wrote.

    The agent MUST be a plain single-argument function, not
    `inference.CheckpointAgent`. `kaggle_environments` sizes an agent's call by
    `getfullargspec`, which counts `self` for a callable object, so it invokes
    such an object with (observation, configuration); the resulting TypeError is
    swallowed under `debug=False`, the seat submits nothing for all 719 steps,
    and the episode still reports status DONE with the bank untouched at 3,000.
    That failure is indistinguishable from a policy that stopped farming, which
    is exactly the quantity this probe exists to measure, so it is written out
    here rather than left as a call-shape detail.
