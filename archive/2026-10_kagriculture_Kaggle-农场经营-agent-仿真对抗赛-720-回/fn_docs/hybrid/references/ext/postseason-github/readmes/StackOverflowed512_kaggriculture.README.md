# Kaggriculture Agent

Kaggriculture is an autonomous, component-based farming agent designed to run in the Kaggle environment. The agent operates a farm over a fixed 30-day (720-hour) season, aiming to maximize terminal cash in the register at the end of the season while complying with strict execution constraints.

---

## Project Overview

The Kaggriculture agent coordinates a farmer (manager) and up to 10 hired day-laborers on a 10x10 grid. It manages the full lifecycle of crops (planting, watering, weeding, harvesting) and handles inventory transactions via a commodity broker. 

### Non-Negotiable Engine Constraints
*   **Command Formats**: All commands for workers (steps, planting, watering, weeding, harvesting) and market orders (hiring, buying seeds, selling) must be Python `list` structures, not dictionaries.
*   **Boots in the Dirt**: Workers must stand directly on a tile to interact with it. The only exception is the central shed tiles `(4,4)`, `(5,4)`, `(4,5)`, `(5,5)`, which allow dropping off or picking up items from adjacent center tiles.
*   **Timeout & Overage**: Every turn must execute within 1 second. Occasional latency spikes are covered by a non-refilling 60-second piggy bank (`remainingOverageTime`).
*   **Exception Containment**: A single unhandled exception or illegal action format zeroes the score for the entire season. The agent entry point must never crash.
*   **Market Limit**: At most 10 market actions (buying, selling, hiring) are processed per turn.
*   **Price Floor**: All items have a hard price floor of $1.

## Current Architecture & Implementation Status

The project is built as a highly decoupled, modular system of components that pass state via well-defined structures, avoiding a monolithic design.

### Implemented Components

1.  **Wrapper & Exception Containment (`main.py`)**: 
    *   Exposes the Kaggle entry point `agent(obs, config)`.
    *   Wraps execution in a sandbox that catches any unexpected runtime error, logs it in telemetry, and degrades to a safe `PASS` action to preserve the season.
    *   Tracks worker positions, daily hiring, and morning sales.
2.  **Rules Loader (`rules_loader.py` & `rules_validated.json`)**: 
    *   Validates and parses the external configuration rulebook containing game laws, dials, priorities, and constants. 
    *   Verifies 9 mandatory constants before loading. It resolves the rules file across a provenance chain (explicit path, the agent's own directory, then the working directory) and falls back to an embedded copy of the rule table if the file cannot be located anywhere, so a missing file degrades to playing on defaults rather than passing the whole season.
3.  **Action Emitter (`action_emitter.py`)**: 
    *   Enforces the list structure for all commands and truncates market orders to the 10-call hourly limit.
4.  **Telemetry (`telemetry.py`)**: 
    *   Tracks in-memory exception metrics and the step hours when they occurred.
5.  **Market Model (`market_model.py`)**: 
    *   Stateless pricing functions that calculate logarithmic, linear, square, and square-root price curves.
    *   Computes the dynamic Economic Value (EV) per tile per turn for crop ranking.
6.  **Care Monitor (`care_monitor.py`)**: 
    *   Statefully tracks watering coverage and shrinks target acreage capacity when plants miss water (thirst), slowly expanding it when the crew is idle.
7.  **Forecaster (`forecaster.py`)**: 
    *   Projects terminal cash based on current cash, shed value, and expected crop yields. Updates a calibration ratio by comparing predictions with actual outcomes.
8.  **Scheduler (`scheduler.py`)**: 
    *   **Priority Bands**: Generates tasks matching 10 urgency priorities (e.g., critical watering, harvesting, planting, weeding) defined in the configuration.
    *   **Same-Day Planting Water**: Ensures newly planted seeds are watered on the same turn to avoid turning into weeds at midnight.
    *   **Greedy Manhattan Matching**: Matches workers to tasks within each priority band by closest distance.
    *   **DROP Pre-emption**: Intercepts workers carrying goods if they exceed a dynamic drop threshold (80% normally, 50% under overflow threat, 0 during endgame) and directs them straight to the shed.
    *   **Endgame Overlay**: Triggered at turn 670. Disables purchases, forces all workers to drop carried goods, uses a cash-test cutoff to stop planting crops that won't mature in time, and liquidates all shed items by calling the broker every turn.

## Testing & Verification

A robust suite of tests verifies the correctness of each component:
*   `test_phase1.py` & `test_phase2.py`: Verify the foundations, rules loader, action emitter, and pricing model.
*   `test_phase3.py`: Verification suite (27 pytest assertions) covering scheduler task priorities, Manhattan step routing, same-day watering, drop pre-emption, capacity controls, and the endgame overlay.

To run the tests:
```bash
python -m pytest test_phase3.py
```
