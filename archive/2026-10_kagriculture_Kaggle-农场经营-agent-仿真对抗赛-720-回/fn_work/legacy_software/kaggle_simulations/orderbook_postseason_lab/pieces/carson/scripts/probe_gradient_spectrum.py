"""Measure whether spectral orthogonalization improves this system's real gradients.

Muon replaces Adam's element-wise adaptive scaling with an approximate spectral
normalization of the momentum matrix: for a 2D weight whose momentum-averaged
gradient is `M = U S V^T`, the update direction is the polar factor
`P(M) = U V^T`, which keeps the singular DIRECTIONS and discards the singular
VALUES.  Whether that helps is not a matter of taste.  It is a property of the
gradient's per-direction signal-to-noise ratio, and the published RL results
split along exactly that line: "When Does Muon Help Agentic Reinforcement
Learning?" (arXiv 2607.16169v1) reports Muon FAILING under single-turn RLVR with
episode-level outcome-only advantages and HELPING under GiGPO's dense
step-level credit, and its Equation 4 gives the criterion.  Writing a noisy
gradient as `Ghat = Gstar + E` with per-singular-direction signal `s_i` and
noise `sigma_i`,

    E<P(Ghat), Gstar>_F = sum_i s_i * (2 * Phi(s_i / sigma_i) - 1)

so flattening the spectrum pays only to the extent that the WEAK directions'
SIGNS are reliable.  That paper measures neither gradient SNR nor update
spectra; it names both as open work.  This script measures them here.

What is measured, on the real update path and nothing else:

  * `Gstar`, the full-batch policy-loss gradient over one staged rollout,
    accumulated through `_actor_minibatch_terms` at production minibatch size,
    autocast and compile mode, with the exact likelihoods stored by the rollout
    sampler as the PPO denominator, matching `update_ppo`. This is the best
    available estimate of the true gradient at this operating point. No
    optimizer is constructed and no step is ever taken.
  * `Ghat_n`, the mean gradient over `n` disjoint minibatches, for several
    effective averaging widths `n`.  Width 20 is the reading of Muon's default
    momentum 0.95 as `1 / (1 - 0.95) = 20`; the variance-equivalent sample size
    of a normalized EMA is `(1 + 0.95) / (1 - 0.95) = 39`, so 20 is the more
    pessimistic (noisier) proxy of the two and both are worth passing.
  * `cos_raw = cos(Ghat_n, Gstar)` and `cos_polar = cos(P(Ghat_n), Gstar)` under
    the Frobenius inner product, where `P` is the EXACT polar factor from a
    float64 SVD, plus `cos_polar_ns5` and `cos_polar_polar_express` from the
    two Newton-Schulz approximations Muon implementations actually run, so the
    verdict can be checked against the approximation as well as the ideal.
  * `alignment_gain = cos_polar - cos_raw`, the headline.  POSITIVE means
    orthogonalization moves the update CLOSER to the true gradient on this
    system's gradients and Muon's premise holds here.  NEGATIVE FALSIFIES THE
    PREMISE for this system: the polar factor would be spending step budget on
    directions whose signs are noise, which is the low-SNR failure mode.
  * The Equation 4 inputs themselves: `s_i` from `Gstar`, the across-minibatch
    standard deviation `sigma_i` of `diag(U^T Ghat V)`, their ratio by rank, and
    the spectral decay and stable rank of `Gstar` - flat spectra are where
    orthogonalization changes little and steep ones where it changes most.

Three diagnostics exist so that a sign cannot be read naively, because a
negative `alignment_gain` has two possible causes and they mean different
things:

  * `spectrum.polar_ceiling`, the value `cos(P(Gstar), Gstar)` that
    orthogonalization would score on a NOISELESS gradient.  It equals one only
    for a perfectly flat spectrum, so a matrix whose `Gstar` spectrum is steep
    pays a fixed alignment cost for flattening however clean its gradient is,
    and `cos_polar` cannot exceed this number.  A negative gain that merely
    reproduces the ceiling is spectral anisotropy, not a noise verdict.
  * `signal_to_noise_split`, the same per-direction SNR taken with the singular
    basis built from one half of the minibatches and the statistics from the
    other.  The specified estimator reads `s_i` off `Gstar`'s own singular
    values, and `Gstar` is a finite-sample gradient whose singular values carry
    the top of the noise spectrum too, which inflates `s_i / sigma_i`.  The
    split basis removes that circularity and instead shrinks the signal, so the
    two bracket the truth.
  * `reference_quality`, the cosine between two independent half-batch
    gradients and the signal energy share it implies for `Gstar`.  This is what
    says whether the reference deserves to be called a signal at all.

Linear weights and Conv2d weights are reported in separate groups.  Conv
gradients are reshaped to `(out_channels, in_channels * kh * kw)`, the standard
Muon convention, because that reshape is a modelling choice a reader may not
accept and it should be judgeable on its own.

MEASURED, and the premise is FALSIFIED here.  Four configurations -- the BC
actor with a freshly initialized critic, the BC actor with the iteration-12
critic, the iteration-12 actor and critic together, and a doubled 224-game wave
-- at 112 or 224 games, 316 minibatches each, averaging width 20:

    group   cos_raw   cos_polar   gain     gain_ns5   gain_holdout   ceiling
    conv    0.37-0.53  0.28-0.40  -0.09..-0.14  worse  -0.017..-0.038  0.75-0.78
    linear  0.38-0.53  0.18-0.25  -0.20..-0.30  worse  -0.009..-0.064  0.47-0.50

Every gain is negative, in every group, in every configuration, for the exact
polar factor AND for the Newton-Schulz approximation Muon actually runs, AND for
the holdout reference that removes the self-alignment circularity.  The three
diagnostics above say this is a noise verdict rather than anisotropy: for linear
weights the noiseless `polar_ceiling` of 0.47-0.50 is itself BELOW the 0.51-0.53
that the raw gradient already achieves, so orthogonalization is capped under the
baseline structurally and not merely degraded by noise.

The Equation 4 inputs explain it.  `signal_to_noise_split_fraction_above_one` is
0.000 in every group of every configuration: with the circularity removed, NO
singular direction carries signal above its across-minibatch noise.  The
gradients are also far from flat -- stable rank 2.7-3.3 out of 96 for linear
weights, top-over-median singular value 48-62 -- so flattening spends the step
budget on a tail that is entirely noise.  That is precisely the low-SNR,
episode-level regime arXiv 2607.16169 reports Muon failing in, and this probe's
historical reward used `gamma = 1.0`. Current training also uses gamma one,
but now uses bounded-margin potential shaping and decoupled VAPO GAE. The old
probe remains optimizer-scale evidence, not a measurement of these targets.

The update path leaves the policy and critic gradients unclipped. This probe
therefore reports raw minibatch gradient norms without a clip-pressure metric.
`PpoConfig.nextlat_max_gradient_norm` applies only to standalone NextLat
predictors, which this policy-only measurement does not construct.

What this CANNOT tell you: it measures the PREMISE of Muon on one operating
point's gradients, not the end-to-end effect of training with Muon.  It says
nothing about Muon's step-size geometry, its weight-decay interaction, or how
the operating point moves once the optimizer changes it.
