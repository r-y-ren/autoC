"""Account for every `torch.compile` entry a run pays for, and refuse late ones.

Update minibatch and rollout row counts are fixed by configuration. Compiled
frozen-league inference buckets its neural lane count and padded width to
powers of two. Only encountered buckets compile before the captured step loop;
persistent ensembles reuse each bucket across changed opponent assignments.
The update still warms the released actor's forward and backward while the
actor is frozen (`ppo.py::_warm_actor_update_graphs`).

First-use league buckets can therefore compile after wave one. The caller
withholds changed-bucket and warmup-transition waves from the settled-wave
contract; this module distinguishes the events it records:

* A **recompile** is a guard failure -- a frame already compiled for one set of
  input properties met inputs that violate its guards, so something varies that
  was supposed to be constant. `CompilationMetrics.cache_size` is the number of
  entries that frame already had, so it is positive exactly here, and Dynamo's
  `recompiles` logging artifact carries the reason, which is why that artifact
  is enabled and captured rather than reconstructed.
* A **late first compile** (`cache_size == 0`) is a previously unseen frame or
  shape. This is expected when the selected league bucket changes, but a fault
  when the caller holds the wave to the settled-shape contract.

Both are only faults once a wave can be held to the contract: the caller
decides that boundary, and passes only settled waves to `check`.

Torch also stores runtime overhead records (including CUDA graph recording)
in the same metrics stream. Their `is_runtime` marker distinguishes them from
compilation; they must not count as new frames or trigger the compile guard.
