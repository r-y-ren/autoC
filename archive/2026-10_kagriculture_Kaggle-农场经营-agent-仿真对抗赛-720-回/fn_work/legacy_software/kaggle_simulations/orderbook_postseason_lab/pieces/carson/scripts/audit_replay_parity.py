"""Audit sampling-vs-update replay parity for a trained actor before launch.

The calibration benchmark also runs `update_replay_parity`, but it does so on a
freshly initialized actor, whose heads are near-uniform.  The divergence this
audits is a function of head sharpness: a random-init actor measures a
per-component KL around 4e-7 where a behavior-cloned one measures around 2e-3,
four orders of magnitude apart.  So calibration alone cannot tell you whether a
*pretrained* actor will clear the gate that training enforces, and a warm start
that fails does so at its first iteration, after the run has already been
queued, compiled and staged.

This runs the shipped gate on the shipped code path -- the same
`update_replay_parity`, the same production minibatch size, autocast and
compilation settings, over a production-sized mixed rollout -- across several
waves, and reports the two gated statistics against their bounds.  Several
waves because one is not evidence of a margin: the statistic is a mean over
hundreds of thousands of components and its spread across independent
environments is what decides whether a measured value sits safely inside the
bound or merely happened to.

What this cannot tell you: the league opponents here are frozen copies of the
actor under audit, which is what iteration zero of a warm start actually plays,
but training enforces the same bound at iterations 25, 50 and beyond, where the
league holds genuinely older snapshots.  The divergence is a function of head
sharpness on the states visited, and different opponents visit different
states, so a passing audit is evidence about the launch iteration rather than a
guarantee for the whole run.  That is what the in-training cadence is for.
