#: Steady iterations each report must contain for a median to mean anything.
#: The old floor was two repeats, which drops the cold start and leaves exactly
#: one steady iteration -- so every "median" was a single sample, and a knob
#: could be decided by one clock-boost dip or one noisy neighbour on the GPU.
#: That decision is then irreversible for the run: it is stamped into run
#: provenance and train_ppo refuses to resume under a different compile mode.
#: Five is what the eager side measured as stable (the steady update within
#: 0.15%, the steady total median within 0.24% of the two-repeat value), and
#: the compiled side needs at least as many because it has warmup eager does
#: not.
MINIMUM_STEADY_SAMPLES = 5
MINIMUM_CALIBRATION_REPEATS = MINIMUM_STEADY_SAMPLES + 1

#: The steady phase median each knob is expected to move, and so the one term
#: of the iteration budget its attribution swaps. The knob names themselves come
#: from `provenance.CALIBRATION_KNOBS`, which is the schema the decision this
#: writes is validated against; naming them twice is how the two drift apart.
KNOB_PHASE_MEDIANS = {
    ROLLOUT_FORWARD_MODE_KNOB: "steady_rollout_seconds_median",
    UPDATE_COMPILE_MODE_KNOB: "steady_update_seconds_median",
}
# What each knob reads as while its phase is uncompiled -- what the chain's
# all-eager first node must declare, and what a knob this decision leaves off
# keeps -- is `provenance.UNCOMPILED_CALIBRATION_MODES`, imported rather than
# restated here for the reason the knob names are: this launcher writes the
# decision that module validates. Neither knob's off value is `False`, because
# both knobs are mode-valued: `eager` is one of `ROLLOUT_FORWARD_MODES` and one
# of `UPDATE_COMPILE_MODES`, an execution mode like the others rather than the
# absence of a choice. The measured ranking is why on the collection side --
# isolated forward, median of 60: eager fp32 4.907 ms, cudagraphs fp32
# 5.309 ms, inductor fp32 2.720 ms, inductor bf16 1.626 ms -- so a boolean
# whose "on" value is `cudagraphs` selects the one mode slower than eager,
# which is what this launcher must not be able to certify. `graph`, the
# collector's own whole-wave capture, was added after that ranking and is not in
# it; a chain that wants it has to measure it, which is the point of the knob
# being mode-valued.

#: Every steady median an iteration's total is made of. Opponent reconstruction
#: is compile-invariant by construction and belongs to no knob, which is
#: exactly the claim each step's held-phase drift measures.
PHASE_MEDIANS = ("steady_opponent_setup_seconds_median", *KNOB_PHASE_MEDIANS.values())
#: How far a summary's summed phase medians may sit from the steady total
#: median drawn from the same iterations, as a fraction of that total. Matched
#: production reports measure 0.07 %; see `_validate_report` for why the gap is
#: not zero and why it must still be bounded.

    The reports form a chain from all-eager to all-compiled in which every step
    turns on exactly one knob and changes nothing else. Two knobs therefore
    need three reports, and the middle one is what makes the decision
    attributable: differencing all-eager against all-compiled moves both knobs
    at once, so each phase's ratio carries whatever between-run drift the pair
    happened to have. That is not hypothetical. The conv calibration this
    design replaces measured the rollout phase at 8.5054 s eager and 8.0847 s
    in a run that also left the rollout uncompiled -- 4.9% apart with the knob
    unchanged -- while crediting the knob itself with 8.0%. Against the report
    that isolates it the rollout knob measures 1.027 and loses; against the
    contaminated pair it measured 1.080 and won.

    Each knob is scored by what it does to the whole iteration, not to its own
    phase: the isolating pair's iteration budget with that knob's phase, and
    only that phase, moved to its measured value under the knob. A per-phase
    ratio flatters a knob whose phase is a small share of the iteration -- the
    rollout knob's 1.027 on an 8 s phase is 1.006 on a 37 s iteration, worth
    under two minutes across a 500-iteration run -- and compilation is not
    free: it costs warmup, replay divergence against the collector, and a
    decision that is stamped into provenance and cannot be revised mid-run.
    Holding every other phase at its measured value on the same side of the
    pair is what keeps the drift out of the number.

    Because each knob is enabled only on top of the knobs before it in the
    chain, the decided configuration is a node of the chain and so was measured
    rather than projected.

    Both knobs are execution modes rather than booleans, so a step turns one from
    `eager` to whichever mode the next node declares, and the decision carries
    that mode rather than a `True`. On the collection side the boolean it
    replaces could only ever mean `cudagraphs`, which measures 5.309 ms against
    eager's 4.907 ms on the isolated forward: the only rollout knob a chain could
    offer was the one mode worth refusing, and no attribution over it could reach
    the 1.626 ms configuration that inductor with bf16 measures. On the update
    side the boolean named four modes at once, so the chain could attribute a
    speedup without recording which of them earned it.
