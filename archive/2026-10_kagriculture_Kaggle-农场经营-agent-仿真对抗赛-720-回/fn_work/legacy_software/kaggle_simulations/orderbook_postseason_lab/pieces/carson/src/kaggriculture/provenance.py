# Bumped to 2 when the compile decision split into a rollout knob and an
# update knob. A version-1 record names a single `compile_models` whose
# per-phase meaning is unrecoverable -- the run it describes could not have
# measured the phases separately -- so it is rejected rather than migrated.
#
# Bumped to 3 when the calibration stopped differencing two runs that change
# both knobs at once. A version-2 record carries per-phase ratios taken across
# a pair whose knobs both moved, so a phase's ratio is contaminated by whatever
# between-run drift the pair happened to have -- and the conv calibration
# measured exactly that, a 4.9% drift on a rollout phase neither run compiled,
# against an 8.0% "speedup" credited to the rollout knob. The evidence a
# version-2 record retains cannot be re-attributed after the fact, because the
# configuration that isolates each knob was never run, so it is rejected rather
# than migrated.
#
# Bumped to 4 when the rollout knob stopped being a boolean. The execution mode
# of the collection forward is the knob now, because the measured ranking is not
# binary: isolated collection forward, median of 60, eager fp32 4.907 ms,
# cudagraphs fp32 5.309 ms, inductor fp32 2.720 ms, inductor bf16 1.626 ms. A
# version-3 record spells `compile_rollout: true` for what was always
# `cudagraphs`, the one mode slower than not compiling at all, so its attributed
# speedup certifies a configuration nothing would now select; and `false` names
# no mode whatsoever. Neither value is a mode, so a version-3 record is rejected
# rather than read as one.
#
# Bumped to 5 when the update knob stopped being a boolean, for the reason the
# rollout knob's bump above records. `torch.compile` takes a mode, and the modes
# are not one measurement: `UPDATE_COMPILE_MODES` spans Inductor fusion alone,
# fusion plus CUDA graph capture, and benchmarked kernel selection with and
# without that capture. Migration is impossible rather than merely unwanted -- a
# version-4 record's `compile_update: true` is compatible with all four of those
# configurations at once and names none of them, so there is nothing to migrate
# it to, and its attributed speedup certifies only that something compiled. No
# version-4 provenance exists on disk.
RUN_PROVENANCE_FORMAT_VERSION = 5
#: The speedup floor a knob must clear to be enabled, measured on the whole
#: iteration rather than on the knob's own phase: a knob that halves a phase
#: worth 2% of an iteration has not earned the compile. It lives here rather
#: than in the launcher because provenance.py is what re-derives each decision
#: from the speedup recorded beside it, and a validator that reads the
#: threshold out of the record it is checking has verified nothing. The
#: launcher imports this; provenance.py cannot import the launcher, since this
#: module ships inside the submission bundle and scripts/ does not.
MINIMUM_COMPILE_SPEEDUP = 1.05
#: The knobs a calibration decides, which is also the schema of the speedups
#: recorded beside them. They live here for the same reason the floor above
#: does: this module re-derives every decision, so the set it validates against
#: cannot be owned by the launcher it is validating. Both knobs are named
#: separately because both values are execution modes rather than booleans, and
#: several places below have to agree on which knob is which.

#: it: `ROLLOUT_FORWARD_MODES` in `kaggriculture.rollout` and
#: `UPDATE_COMPILE_MODES` in `kaggriculture.ppo`. This module deliberately
#: imports neither. `build_submission.PACKAGE_FILES` ships provenance.py into
#: the submission bundle and ships neither of those two, and both pull in
#: dependencies the bundle does not have -- rollout.py `kaggle_environments` and
#: the native extension, ppo.py the whole update path -- so either import would
#: be a ModuleNotFoundError at agent startup, exactly where
#: `inference.CheckpointAgent` validates a checkpoint's run provenance. Only the
#: off value of each knob is needed here, because all this module re-derives is
#: whether a knob was enabled, and an inference agent has no legitimate interest
#: in which backend collected the rollouts it learned from or compiled the
#: update that consumed them.
#:
#: Membership in a domain is enforced wherever that domain is knowable: argparse
#: `choices=` at every entrypoint, and the launcher's `_declared_knobs`, which
#: reads both modes out of the benchmark reports a decision is derived from. That
#: is what makes the structural check in `_decided_knob_enabled` sufficient
#: rather than lax -- a mode outside its domain cannot match any launchable
#: `--rollout-forward-mode` or `--update-compile-mode`, so training refuses the
#: record whose calibration names it.

# cannot be hashed as though it were. Cargo's target directory embeds the
# absolute path it was built at -- 82 files under one such tree contain this
# machine's home directory -- along with the exact compiler in
# .rustc_info.json. An identity covering that is machine-, path- and
# toolchain-cache-dependent, so a clean checkout of the same commit on another
# machine can never reproduce it, which is the opposite of what a
# content-addressed identity is for.
#
# It is also unsound in a way that bites a single machine, because the identity
# is computed once at startup while rollout.load_native() shells out to `cargo
# build` at the first rollout. A run whose build was stale at launch stamps its
# checkpoints with the pre-build identity, mutates the tree, and then fails
# require_source_identity against itself on resume -- a wedge the run inflicts
# on itself with no external trigger.
#
# A cache directory inside a source root is an error, never a prune. Cargo
# writes CACHEDIR.TAG into every target directory, as do the pytest, ruff and
# mypy caches, so the tag identifies that whole class -- but *acting* on it by
# pruning is a silent drop, and by the argument below a silent drop is the
# failure that cannot be recovered from. Skipping a tagged directory would
# delete whatever it holds from the identity with nothing to say so, and there
# is no contents test that could make that safe: a cargo target tree genuinely
# contains Rust, since build scripts emit `build/*/out/*.rs` and this tree
# carries three from serde and target-lexicon.
#
# Scoping the prune to the crate was the first attempt and it was not enough.
# Cargo compiles `benches/` and `examples/` too, so protecting only `src/` and
# `tests/` left real crate source droppable by one stray file. The rule that
# actually holds is the simple one: build output does not belong inside a
# source root at all. Cargo's conventional location is excluded by path before
# the tag is ever consulted, so nothing legitimate reaches this check, and
# anything that does is a misconfigured CARGO_TARGET_DIR worth stopping for.
#
# Excluded by path rather than by bare name: as a name it also swallowed
# `scripts/target/`, which has nothing to do with cargo. `__pycache__` stays a
# name because it is one wherever it appears, and holds only the bytecode of
# files already hashed.

# Neither a denylist nor an allowlist is safe on its own, because they fail in

# identity machine-dependent -- bad, but it announces itself the first time a
# clean checkout fails require_source_identity. A bare allowlist silently
# *drops* whatever it has not been taught to include, and that is strictly
# worse: two trees that differ in a real input then share one identity, so the
# provenance claim is false rather than merely unreproducible, and nothing
# anywhere fails to say so.
#
# So the union is closed and an unclassified file is an error. The cost is that
# adding a source file of a new kind stops the next launch until someone says
