"""Measure whether a collapsed policy wins by destroying the shared economy.

`_relative_score(a, b) = (a - b) / (a + b)` is scale invariant, so a mirror
game scores 0.0 whether both banks hold 150,000 or 3,000, and it saturates
against a fixed opponent, so 57,000 against `starter` scores about as well as
143,000 does. Neither property tells a policy to stay rich. What that leaves
open is the direction of causation in a league game: the collapsed policy's
league score rate *rose* from 0.302 to 0.578 while league money fell 4.5x, and
only a head-to-head money matrix can say whether it learned to win by growing
its own margin or by pulling a market-dependent opponent down with it.

This runs every ordered pair of a set of actors and reports both banks, so a
diagonal (mirror) cell gives each actor's wealth against an equal and the
off-diagonal cells show what each does to the other.
