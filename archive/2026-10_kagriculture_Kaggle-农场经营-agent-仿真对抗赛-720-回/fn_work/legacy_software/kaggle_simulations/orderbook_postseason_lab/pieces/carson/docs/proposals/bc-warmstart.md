# Behavior-Cloning Warm-Start from a Public Agent

Status: **done and measured.** The teacher moved from `public-v27` to
`public-v16` on evidence; see "Measured outcome" below. Owner: training pipeline.

## Measured outcome

`runs/bc6-v16-mixed/bc-actor.pt`, four `public-v16` corpora at
`--seeds-per-dataset 256` (mirror, vs-starter, vs-pass, vs-random), 20 epochs,
NorMuon + Adam on the reference's trapezoid. Holdout NLL 0.000133 on wholly
held-out seeds, all three heads at 0.9999+ top-1. Play, in the OFFICIAL
`kaggle_environments` engine, deterministic decode, 2 seeds x both seat orders
per opponent (`scripts/external_eval_worker.py`):

| opponent | clone bank | opponent bank | score rate |
|---|---|---|---|
| `starter` | 144,417 | 3,507 | **1.000** |
| `public-v27` | 83,803 | 76,016 | **0.750** |
| `public-v16` (its own teacher) | 88,657 | 88,317 | **0.750** |

Three things this settles.

**The teacher choice was the whole game.** The v27-taught clone
(`runs/bc5-mixed-conv`) scored 0.078 against v27; the v16-taught clone scores
0.750 against that same opponent. `public-v16` itself beat `public-v27` 6/6 in
the official engine, median bank 77,261 to 59,489, so the corpus ceiling moved
and the clone moved with it.

**Opponent breadth, not corpus depth, is what generalizes.** An uncapped
single-opponent clone reached 99.996% holdout accuracy and still could not act
when the opponent was poor: on those states it agreed with its teacher on 56.4%
of unit decisions, and transplanting rich-opponent features back in restored
99.99% agreement. It was gated on the opponent's wealth channels. A fifth of the
seeds across four opponents fixed that, and 1.000 against `starter` is the
measurement that says so -- `starter` is exactly the poor opponent the
single-opponent clone could not handle.

**Holdout NLL has stopped being the useful axis.** At 0.9999+ accuracy the
residual is confidence on decisions that are already correct. Every further
comparison here -- the NextLat A/B included -- is decided on bank and score rate
in the official engine, with NLL reported only as a sanity check.

## Why

Self-play PPO from scratch has converged to a local optimum around 34-36k
money that exploits none of the game's compounding subsystems. Measured
evidence (iteration ~95-346 of run `vapo-lv2-20260813`):

- Land purchases: exactly 0 across every audited iteration.
- Animal economy (PLACE/FEED/CARE): 0 actions, ever.
- DIG: extinct; weeds sterilize ~26% of the farm by late game.
- Hiring: peaks at ~6.7 of 16 slots; deterministic decode hires 3.
- The public v27 agent banks ~145k and beat our iteration-95 checkpoint
  0-64. The ~9x gap lives in subsystems that are mutually gating (land ->
  more tiles -> more units -> animal loops), which random exploration
  cannot cross because each subsystem alone is a shaped-reward dip.

Behavior cloning from a strong public agent moves the policy across that
gap in one step, then RL fine-tuning optimizes from a basin where the
subsystems already pay for themselves.

## Teacher: what v27 actually is

`/var/tmp/kaggriculture-kaito-v27-main.py` (sha f48c2116...) is a ~99.3%
baked 719-step action trace (`_LEGACY_ACTIONS`, zlib+base85) with two thin
runtime behaviors: actor-local WEED repair and SELL-slot ordering by price
impact and Town demand. Both seats play one coherent route (HIRE4 opening).

Consequences we accept, not work around:

- The demonstrations are nearly open-loop. BC will substantially key on
  the step-phase features (`global_features` carries step/EPISODE_STEPS
  and its complement), learning a time-indexed program with weak state
  conditioning. That is acceptable for a warm start: the goal is to seed
  subsystem usage, and RL fine-tuning supplies the state-conditioned
  corrections afterward.
- Observation diversity still exists across episodes: market prices are
  shared state moved by both players' trades, and the opponent half of the
  board varies. Extracting against a diverse opponent pool exercises that.

## Dataset extraction

New script `scripts/extract_bc_dataset.py` (CPU only, no mlq needed):

1. Run official `kaggle_environments` episodes with v27 in the recorded
   seat against an opponent pool: v27 mirror, our latest checkpoint
   (sampled and deterministic), and the starter bot. Both seats of the
   v27-mirror games are demonstrations, doubling yield.
2. Per step, record the raw observation dict for the demonstrating seat
   plus the opposing seat's private state (our training-time encode takes
   `opponent_private`; the submission path tolerates its absence).
3. Parse the engine action dict `{"farmer": cmd, "hands": [cmds],
   "market": [orders]}` back into factor targets — the exact inverse of
   `actions.compile_action`:
   - unit commands -> `UnitAction` ids via the `_MOVE_COMMAND`,
     `_PLANT_CROP`, `_PICKUP_SPEC`, `_PLACE_ANIMAL` tables' inverses;
   - market orders -> (`MarketKind`, quantity index). `QUANTITY_BINS` is
     the exact range 1..100, and a decode of v27's trace confirms its
     orders max out at quantity 53 across at most 10 slots (our
     `MAX_MARKET_ORDERS`), so every demonstrated order is losslessly
     representable; any future teacher exceeding a cap is a hard
     extraction error, not a silent clamp.
4. Compute masks exactly as `policy.act_batch` does, teacher-forced: unit
   k's mask is conditioned on the demonstration's actions for units 0..k-1
   (via `apply_unit_shed_effect`/`apply_unit_tile_effect` and seed
   decrements), and market slot masks evolve through `MarketLedger` with
   the demonstrated orders. A demonstrated action that its own mask
   forbids is a hard error — it means our mask model diverges from the
   engine, which we must know before training on the data.
5. Round-trip validation: re-`compile_action` the parsed factors and
   require exact equality with v27's original action dict for every step.
6. Output: one compressed `.npz` per episode under
   `runs/bc-dataset-<date>/` — encoded tensors (board, global, units,
   positions), factor targets, masks, active flags — plus a `manifest.json`
   with teacher sha, opponent, seed, and final banks.

Scale: 719 steps x ~1.4k decision rows per episode; 128-256 episodes gives
roughly 200-400k state rows, ample for this model size (a few M params).

## Loss and training

New script `scripts/train_bc.py`, queued through `mlq`:

- Forward the standard `FarmActor`; compute per-component masked
  log-probabilities with the existing `component_selected_logprobs`
  machinery (same masking semantics as PPO replay — no new code path).
- Loss: negative mean log-likelihood over active components (unit
  components where `unit_active`, market kind slots reached, quantity
  slots for quantified kinds), i.e. exactly the factored likelihood PPO
  optimizes, with demonstration actions substituted. AdamW, cosine decay,
  early stop on held-out episode NLL (hold out whole episodes, not steps —
  steps within an episode are nearly duplicates across the dataset).
- Metrics per head: masked NLL and top-1 accuracy for unit actions,
  market kinds, quantities; entropy of the cloned policy.
- Acceptance gate (before any RL): the BC actor loaded into
  `CheckpointAgent` and replayed on the official engine must itself buy
  land, hire 4, run animals, and bank a substantial multiple of 36k in
  self-play — target within ~2x of v27's ~145k. If greedy decode of the
  clone cannot reproduce the route, the clone failed and RL will not fix
  it.

## RL fine-tune integration

1. Initialize a fresh run whose actor weights come from the BC
   checkpoint; the critic starts fresh (BC gives no value function).
2. Critic-first fitting: for the first ~10-20 iterations run rollouts and
   critic-only updates so the actor is not pushed by advantages from an
   unfit critic. This reuses the `critic_epochs` split in
   `update_ppo` — one small extension (allow actor participation in zero
   epochs for a configured warmup) rather than a new code path. The
   existing `target_kl` gate then governs the transition, no LR hacks.
3. League: seed the frozen-opponent archive with the BC snapshot so the
   learner must keep beating its own starting point; PFSP retires it
   automatically once fully beaten.
4. Watch entropy explicitly: the clone will start far sharper than a
   scratch policy (entropy well below the ~0.66-0.80 band we see now).
   That is expected; intervene only if the in-loop external eval (see
   metrics task) shows regression toward pre-BC behavior, and then by
   diagnosis, not a reflexive entropy floor.
5. Provenance: the BC dataset manifest (teacher sha, episode seeds) and
   the BC checkpoint digest go into `run_provenance` so any resulting
   submission can be traced to its imitation source.

## Deferred: the rest of nanogpt's schedule

What is ported today (`scripts/train_bc.py`, `src/kaggriculture/optim.py`) is
the *trapezoid* and the *momentum warmup*: a rate flat for the first 40% of
scheduled steps, then linear to a 0.15 floor rather than to zero, with NorMuon's
momentum ramping 0.85 -> 0.95 over the first 300 steps. Measured against plain
AdamW on a cosine at matched wall clock, that plus the spectral step took
holdout NLL from 0.0028 in 20 epochs to 0.00182 in 10.

What is NOT ported, and is the next thing to try here rather than in RL:

- **Per-role rate and decay multipliers.** `modded-nanogpt`'s `param_table`
  gives every parameter role its own `lr_mul` and `wd_mul`
  (`train_gpt.py:2026-2050`): embeddings 75x, the output head 5x, scalars 5x,
  the residual and value lambdas 1-5x, all on top of the base rate, and the
  shape multiplier `sqrt(fan_in)` on top of that for matrices. We collapse all
  of that into ONE number: `adam_learning_rate_ratio = 0.35`, the reference's
  own 0.008/0.023 matrix-to-Adam ratio, applied uniformly to every gain, bias,
  embedding and head. That is the crudest possible reading of the recipe, and
  the embedding multiplier is the one most likely to be load-bearing: our
  tokenizer embeddings are the first thing every observation passes through.
- **The batch-size and window ramps.** nanogpt grows both across training
  (`TRAINING_STAGES`, `train_gpt.py:1992-2010`). Our epoch is a full pass over a
  fixed corpus with one window, so this needs a decision about what "stage"
  means for a demonstration corpus before it can be ported at all.

Deferred deliberately, by direction, so that the NextLat auxiliary is measured
against one pretraining recipe rather than two moving at once.

## Risks

- Mask-model divergence from the real engine surfaces as extraction
  errors (step 4/5 above). This is the highest-value failure mode: it
  would also mean our RL masks are wrong.
- The clone may be brittle off-distribution (opponent plays into board
  states v27 never saw). Mitigated by extraction-vs-our-checkpoint games
  and by RL fine-tuning itself.
- MAX_UNITS: v27's HIRE4 route stays far below our rust cap of 16, so the
  known latent cap divergence stays latent.
- Kaggle legality: v27 is a public notebook agent; training on its public
  trace is standard practice, but the submission must be our network, not
  the trace — which this plan guarantees by construction.

## Effort estimate

- Extraction script + inverse-action parser + round-trip tests: ~1 day.
- BC trainer + metrics + acceptance replay: ~0.5-1 day (GPU hours: <1 on
  the 5090 at this model size).
- RL integration (critic-first warmup flag, league seeding, provenance):
  ~0.5 day.
