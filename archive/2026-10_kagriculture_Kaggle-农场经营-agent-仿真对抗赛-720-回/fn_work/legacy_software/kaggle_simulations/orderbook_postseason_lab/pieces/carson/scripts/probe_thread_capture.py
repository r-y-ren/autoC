"""Ask whether two shard threads can each own and replay a CUDA graph.

The rollout is launch-bound: 1,669 kernel launches a step against 4.7 ms of
actual device work, so the lever is collapsing launches, and the way to collapse
them is capture. Inductor's `reduce-overhead` is the off-the-shelf route and it
does not survive this collector. `torch._inductor.cudagraph_trees` holds a tree
manager per *thread* but keys generations off a process-global counter, so one
shard's `cudagraph_mark_step_begin` retires the other shard's live outputs; the
guard in `rollout._cuda_graph_generation` fixes that specific race, and the mode
then wedges somewhere else with every thread parked on a futex. Two full-wave
probes cost twenty-five minutes of an idle exclusive GPU lease between them and
returned no stack, which is too expensive a way to keep asking.

So ask the underlying question directly instead, with no compiler and no
simulator in the way: two threads, two side streams, one `torch.cuda.CUDAGraph`
each over the real actor forward at the real production shapes, captured under
the `torch.inference_mode` and bf16 autocast the collector actually runs in,
then replayed concurrently. That isolates the CUDA-level feasibility of the
design from `cudagraph_trees`' bookkeeping, and it runs in seconds.

A pass means an explicit per-shard graph is a viable replacement for the mode
that keeps hanging, and reports what one replay costs against one eager
forward. A failure here means capture cannot serve two shards at all and the
launch count has to come down some other way -- which is worth knowing for the
price of one short job rather than another twenty-five minute stall.

Inputs are zero-filled at the shapes `allocate_rollout_storage` defines rather
than encoded from a live wave. The question is mechanical -- does capture hold,
and does replay reproduce the eager result from the same buffers -- and the
equivalence check compares graph against eager on identical inputs, so it is
just as sharp on zeros. Nothing here is evidence about throughput of a real
collection; `probe_rollout_utilization.py` remains the measurement.
