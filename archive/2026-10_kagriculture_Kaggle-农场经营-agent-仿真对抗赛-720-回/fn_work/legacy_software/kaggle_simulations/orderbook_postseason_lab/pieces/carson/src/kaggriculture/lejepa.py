"""LeJEPA world-model objective: attached next-step targets, SIGReg, and reward.

The auxiliary here is LeWorldModel (Maes, Le Lidec, Scieur, LeCun and Balestriero,
arXiv:2603.19312; reference checkout at ``../le-wm``), which is LeJEPA
(arXiv:2511.08544, ``../lejepa``) applied to transitions rather than to augmented
views. LeWM's whole claim is that a stable end-to-end world model needs exactly
two terms -- a next-embedding prediction loss and a regularizer forcing the
embeddings to be isotropic Gaussian -- with no EMA, no teacher, no stop-gradient,
no frozen pretrained encoder, and no masking or corruption of the input.

This transplant keeps that shape exactly:

* **Attached targets.** The regression target is the encoder's own embedding of
  ``o_{t+1}``, with its gradient live. Every other self-predictive objective in
  this repository (`latent_dynamics`, `structured_dynamics`, `actor_dynamics`)
  detaches that target, because an attached target is minimized by a constant
  encoder. LeWM's answer is that the anti-collapse job belongs to a distributional
  constraint, not to an asymmetry in the graph. `jepa_horizon_loss(detach_target=True)`
  is the ablation: a stop-gradient on the successor's embedding alone, without an
  EMA teacher, which is what cleanrl's JEPA-PPO does.
* **SIGReg.** Random unit directions are drawn through the embedding and each
  one-dimensional marginal is pushed onto ``N(0, 1)`` by an Epps-Pulley
  characteristic-function statistic. A collapsed embedding has a degenerate
  marginal in every direction and is maximally penalized.
* **Nothing is corrupted.** Observations enter the encoder exactly as the policy
  sees them. The only supervision signal is the passage of one step.
* **No temporal conditioning.** LeWM's predictor is autoregressive over a short
  frame history with per-frame position embeddings. This one is Markov: it reads
  the current step's embedding and the executed joint action, nothing else. That
  matches what the policy and the critic on this encoder are allowed to know --
  neither carries recurrent state across turns -- so a latent that needed a
  history to be predictable would be a latent no consumer here could use.

Two additions the setting forces:

* **Reward.** LeWM predicts observations only; this predicts the reward collected
  on the transition as well, which is the one part of the next step that the
  encoded observation cannot contain.
* **Structured, multi-token latents.** LeWM pools a frame to one CLS embedding.
  This environment's decisions are per unit and per market slot, so the embedding
  is per token, and SIGReg runs per latent group -- a farm tile and a market-order
  slot share neither support nor scale, and one normality test over their union is
  satisfiable by a mixture that is degenerate inside every component.

**One backbone, owned by this objective.** The encoder is shared by the actor and
the critic, and both put their own capacity *after* the world model rather than
inside it. The critic reads `JepaBelief.detach()`; the actor's heads read it
attached (`LejepaConfig.policy_shapes_backbone`), so the policy's loss shapes the
encoder beside this one. Pure LeJEPA -- a representation fixed by the
self-supervised objective alone -- is kept as the detached ablation, and it does
not survive sampling: it clones the teacher at argmax and goes bankrupt once a
sampled decision leaves the teacher's trajectory, because nothing in a
teacher-prediction objective says which of the off-trajectory facts a decision
needs. One encoder is still the right count; a second would be the same
observation fitted twice.

What this does *not* defend against, stated plainly because the telemetry exists
to measure it: a one-step attached target is also minimized by an encoder that is
constant *along a trajectory* while varying across the batch, and SIGReg cannot
see that -- across the batch such an embedding is still perfectly normal, so both
the statistic and `dispersion` read clean while the backbone both towers share is
destroyed. The defenses are the reward term and the two controls journaled every
wave (`JepaPersistenceControl`, `JepaShuffledControl`). A prediction loss that
matches persistence, or that survives shuffling the actions across rows, is
measuring nothing -- though persistence alone cannot separate the two, because a
trajectory-constant encoder sends the baseline to zero along with the loss. The
column that does is `motion`: the RMS displacement of the *latents* -- the trunk
output the policy and the value function read, not the projected embedding, since
the projector is discarded after training -- between a row and its successor,
relative to their own scale and over supervised tokens only. That number going to
zero *is* the failure, and it is the one to cull a run on -- by hand, since
nothing gates a run on it automatically. The policy
gradient that also reaches the encoder is a third defense, but a weak one: it
constrains only what the decisions read, so `motion` stays the number to watch.

The module is training-only. Nothing here is an actor submodule: league snapshots,
inference bundles and frozen-ensemble stacks consume the actor's state dict whole
and have no business carrying a predictor or a projector the deployed model never
evaluates.

class SIGReg(nn.Module):
    """Sliced Epps-Pulley normality statistic, weighted over the sample axis.

    ``forward`` consumes a ``[samples, features]`` or ``[samples, tokens, features]``
    embedding and a ``[features, slices]`` matrix of unit-norm directions.
    Projecting an isotropic standard Gaussian onto a unit direction gives exactly
    ``N(0, 1)`` whatever the feature count, which is why one fixed reference
    characteristic function ``exp(-t^2/2)`` serves every slice.

    The reduction runs over the sample axis alone and the statistic is averaged
    over token positions -- ``../le-wm/module.py``'s ``.mean(-3)``, which reduces
    the batch axis and leaves every position its own test. Flattening the token
    axis into the sample axis instead would test only the union, and a union of
    degenerate components is not degenerate: an encoder that gave every farm tile
    a distinct constant -- which `TileEmbedder.slot_embedding` alone can express,
    and which makes the prediction term exactly zero -- passes a pooled test at a
    tenth the penalty of real collapse. Per position it does not, because the
    population behind each position is then that slot across the batch, and a
    slot that is constant across the batch is an atom. Positions no row supervises
    are dropped rather than scored against an empty sample.

    The one deliberate departure from the reference is its ``* n`` scaling, which
    is dropped. That factor is what turns the quantity into a calibrated test
    statistic -- ``O(1)`` under the null whatever the sample count -- and it is
    right for a hypothesis test. It is wrong here, and not harmlessly so. It
    cancels exactly out of the per-sample gradient, so what it actually scales is
    the ratio between this term and the prediction term, which is a mean and whose
    per-sample gradient therefore falls like ``1/n``. Keeping it would make the
    trade-off coefficient a function of the minibatch size, the token count per
    group, and -- through the mask -- how many units happen to be alive. The
    reference can afford that because its ``n`` is a fixed 128 with one token per
    sample; this trainer's is tens of thousands and differs group by group. So the
    weighted quadrature error is returned as a mean over samples, the coefficient
    means the same thing in every configuration, and the reference's statistic is
    this value times the sample count whenever anyone wants it back.

    Positions are then combined in proportion to their own support rather than
    equally, and that is what makes the two paragraphs above compatible. Dropping
    ``* n`` is only safe while ``n`` is common to everything being compared; the
    mask makes it differ *within* one call, and a position's statistic falls like
    ``1 / n_position``, so a unit slot alive in five rows scores like a collapsed
    embedding on sampling noise alone. Measured at 1024 rows over sixteen
    positions: hold one position at five supporting rows and an equal-weight mean
    reads 0.014 against a null of 0.0010 and total collapse at 0.92 -- seven
    percent of the way to collapse with nothing having changed. Worse than the
    magnitude is the direction, because the single-sample Epps-Pulley error is
    minimized at the origin: the anti-collapse term would pull hardest on exactly
    the slots it has least evidence about, and every unit the agent learns to hire
    would trip it afresh. Weighting by ``count`` is the reference's ``* n``
    restored per position and divided out once at the end, so each *row* carries
    the same gradient wherever it sits, the aggregate is flat in occupancy, and
    under a uniform mask it is identical to the plain mean it replaces.

    In eager the samples are chunked and each chunk's partial sums are
    rematerialized in backward: the reference's single-shot form holds a
    ``[samples, tokens, slices, knots]`` intermediate, which at this trainer's
    sample counts is measured in gigabytes. Under `torch.compile` the loop is
    skipped entirely -- Inductor's min-cut partitioner already decides what to
    keep and what to recompute across that intermediate, and a Python-level chunk
    loop only multiplies the traced subgraphs (one checkpointed higher-order op
    per chunk per group) and the compile time it costs to reach the same answer.

    Weighted because inactive unit slots carry an exactly zero latent, and an atom
    at the origin is a departure from normality the encoder cannot fix and should
    not be asked to.

    both are why this is an attention round rather than the per-token residual MLP
    the detached NextLat transplant uses:

    * a tile can attend to the action of the unit standing on it, which is how
      nearly every observable transition in this environment is actually caused;
    * one token's prediction can depend on the others, so the model can express
      "this unit harvested, so that tile empties and that product token gains
      stock" instead of extrapolating every slot in isolation.

    The reference conditions a stack of AdaLN-zero blocks on a single pooled action
    vector per frame. A pooled vector cannot say *which* of sixteen units did what,
    and this action is a joint action over sixteen unit slots and ten order slots,
    so the conditioning is per-slot attention context instead. No position
    embedding and no frame history: the prediction is Markov by construction.

    ``prediction`` composes the reference's predictor and its ``pred_proj`` into
    one residual: ``emb + pred_proj(round(emb, action))`` with the output layer
    zero-initialized. At initialization the predictor is the identity, which is the
    better of the two constant predictions available -- a farm is overwhelmingly
    unchanged from one step to the next -- so the objective's early gradient
    carries transition signal rather than the noise of an untrained readout.

    The reward head deliberately sits outside the attention round. Under this
    trainer's production terminal-outcome rewards the entire signal lives on the
    final step of an episode, and that step is never a transition source: it has no
    successor inside the rollout. A reward head placed behind the round would be
    trained on an all-zero target. This one reads pooled embeddings and the pooled

    That optimizer additionally owns the shared backbone, which is the one thing
    here that is *not* disposable. The encoder's gradient is this objective's plus
    the policy's (the critic's tower reads a detached belief), and stepping it with
    the projector and predictor is stepping one model: splitting them across two
    optimizers would only give one objective two learning rates.

    The minibatch's slice directions and its tile sample live in non-persistent
    buffers that `refresh_slices` overwrites in place between minibatches. Buffer
    identity, shape and dtype never change, so the compiled update graph is traced
    once and no recompilation follows a refresh; only the values move. Drawing
    them here rather than inside the step is what keeps the compiled region free
    of RNG -- see `sigreg_directions`.
