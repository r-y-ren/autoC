"""Attribute a policy collapse to flattened weights or to unseen states.

Entropy in the training journal is measured over the states the collector
happened to visit, so a rise has two indistinguishable explanations. Either the
update flattened the policy where it already knew what to do, or the policy
wandered somewhere it had never been and the clone -- which never saw those
states -- is near-uniform there through no change of its own. The journal cannot
tell these apart and they call for opposite fixes: a smaller trust region for the
first, broader demonstrations or a recovery signal for the second.

Holding the states fixed separates them. One reference policy rolls out once,
its visited states are recorded, and every checkpoint is scored on that single
batch. Any entropy difference is then weight movement and nothing else, because
the states did not move. Rolling each checkpoint out on its own states measures
the other half: the gap between the two readings is what the collector's
distribution shift contributes.

Single-threaded CPU only, no autocast, deterministic given `--seed`.
