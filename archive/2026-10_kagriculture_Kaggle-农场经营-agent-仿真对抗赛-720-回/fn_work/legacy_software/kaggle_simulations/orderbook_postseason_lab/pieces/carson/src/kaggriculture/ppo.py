#: 720-step game that scores early decisions by the critic -- whose Monte Carlo
#: R-squared stays at 0.10-0.23 through a warm-started run. From the clone every
#: 0.972 arm collapsed (zero argmax wins against V27 at wave 50) while lambda one
#: beat the clone itself 0.992 argmax at the same wave while keeping V27 at 0.977,
#: the only arm to improve on the clone against both (artifacts/probes/ppo-ablations-20260927).
#: The two stay separate knobs, so the decoupled VAPO trace remains selectable.

_REPLAY_AUDIT_SHUFFLE_SEED = 20260815

#: Share of value targets the critic support may saturate before the run is
#: stopped. VAPO decoupled GAE fits the critic on the lambda-one return, which
#: does not add the critic's own prediction, but a bounded categorical mean
#: still cannot represent a target outside the atoms. A small saturated share
#: is ordinary error escaping the outermost atom. What this catches is the
#: degenerate end: a critic collapsed onto the edge atom, whose every target is
#: then clipped to a constant label that holds it there.
#:
#: The bound cannot be read off that description, because a categorical critic's
#: mean is itself bounded by its support -- the runaway saturates a share, never
#: the whole batch. Measured over 32 production-length trajectories whose
#: potential is a bounded random walk, with the critic pinned at a constant:
#:
#:     V     0.00  1.00  1.50  2.00  2.10  2.15  2.20
#:     share 0.000 0.000 0.000 0.007 0.072 0.186 0.374
#:
#: So a critic pinned at the outermost atom, the worst state reachable, reaches
#: 0.374 and any bound at or above that is inert. Anything a working critic
#: produces sits at zero with the whole 0.2 of headroom to spare, which leaves a
#: wide band to place this in; 0.05 is an order of magnitude above the first
#: non-zero reading and still fires well before the collapse completes.
MAX_VALUE_TARGET_SATURATED_FRACTION = 0.05

#: Mean policy entropy per active component, below which the policy is dead.
#:
#: Measured, not chosen from taste. A learning-rate sweep against the native
#: built-ins (`artifacts/probes/trust-cliff.json`) found a second failure mode
#: this pipeline could not see: at 1e-4 the actor converges within a dozen
#: iterations onto passing every turn -- entropy 0.000 nats, final money exactly
#: 3000, the starting bank untouched, and 0.000 score rate against every
#: built-in. Nothing in the telemetry called it: the epoch completes 100% of its
#: minibatches precisely because a deterministic policy has no KL movement to
#: bound, `actor_updates` reads 113 of 113, and money *rose* to its maximum.
#:
#: It is also terminal rather than a phase. The gradient of a clipped surrogate
#: comes from sampled alternatives, so a policy that samples nothing has no
#: signal with which to leave, and the run burns GPU-hours converged on the
#: reward's inaction basin -- passing scores -0.074 against `starter`, where
#: trading badly scores -0.75, so the objective genuinely prefers doing nothing
#: to farming incompetently and PPO is not misbehaving by finding that.
#:
#: The level is a ceiling on the floor, not the floor itself, because it does not
#: survive a warm start from a faithful clone. From-scratch runs that learned
#: measured 0.14 to 0.37 nats and collapsed ones 0.000 to 0.001, so 0.01 sat an
#: order of magnitude clear of both. The v16-KL clones then measured 0.00896 nats
#: at their first actor-active iteration -- below this level while holding NLL
#: 0.001 and 0.99996 unit accuracy, and beating `public-v27` in play. A faithful
#: clone of a sharp teacher legitimately starts sharper than any from-scratch run
#: ever gets, so an absolute floor calibrated on from-scratch entropy refuses the
#: strongest artifacts this project has. At 0.01 nats a component's top action
#: holds about 99.8% of the mass, which is past exploration for a policy that
#: arrived there by converging -- and unremarkable for one that was trained to
#: imitate.
MINIMUM_POLICY_ENTROPY = 0.01

#: Share of its own first actor-active entropy a policy must keep.
#:
#: Paired with the level above as `min(level, fraction * reference)`: whichever
#: is *lower* gates the run. A from-scratch run starting at 0.29 nats is judged
#: against 0.01 exactly as before, since a quarter of its start is looser; a
#: clone starting at 0.00896 is judged against 0.00224 rather than being refused
#: on its first update. `min` rather than `max` because a policy sharpening as it
#: converges is the expected trajectory, not a failure, and no measurement here
#: bounds how much of its starting spread a healthy run may spend -- so the
#: reference may only relax a level that has evidence behind it, never tighten
#: one that does not.
#:
#: The reference is measured at the first iteration the actor actually updates,
#: which is why the warmup exemption is load-bearing rather than cosmetic: a
#: frozen actor reports the entropy it was initialized with, and a critic-warmup
#: window would otherwise calibrate the floor against a policy that has not yet
#: taken a step.
POLICY_ENTROPY_FLOOR_FRACTION = 0.25

#: Entropy at or below which a policy is already collapsed, whatever it started
#: at. Collapsed runs measured 0.000 to 0.001 nats; 0.002 is twice the worst of
#: those. Its one job is to refuse a *reference* inside that range: a floor that
#: is a share of a collapsed start sits below the collapse and switches the gate
#: off for the remaining iterations, which is the failure the gate exists for
#: arriving before it can be measured.
MINIMUM_POLICY_ENTROPY_REFERENCE = 0.002

#: Share of its intended minibatches an actor epoch must actually apply.
#:
#: `actor_updates < 1` was already refused, and that bound is too weak by
#: exactly the amount that matters: a trust region mis-set against the policy's
#: sharpness stops the epoch after the first minibatch, not before it, so the
#: run reports one update and passes. That is what happened -- 66 iterations at
#: 1 of 113 minibatches, 0.9% of each wave, with `approx_kl` reading 6e-4
#: because it is a mean over the minibatches that stepped and almost none did.
#: Nothing in the telemetry looked wrong.
#:
#: The premise that set this at half was that a healthy iteration applies all of
#: them -- 113 of 113 at every rate whose movement fits inside `target_kl`, and
#: 113 of 113 for the 500 iterations of the run this replaces. That premise was
#: measured on waves the actor had almost no gradient on: self-play against its
#: own snapshots. Against opponents it cannot beat, the schedule that learns
#: fastest applies 89% of the epoch on average and 31% on its worst wave, so half
#: forbids the best configuration measured while the pathology it exists to catch
#: reads 1%.
#:
#: 0.15 keeps both properties. It is 2x below the worst wave of the shipped
#: schedule, which is the margin an unlucky draw needs, and 17x above the 0.009
#: that burned 66 iterations -- a gap no partial epoch can cross by accident.
#: The mismatch it guards against is still measurable at the far end of the same
#: sweep: 3.0e-4 against a 0.03 bound applies exactly 1 of 113 on every iteration.
MINIMUM_ACTOR_EPOCH_FRACTION = 0.15

#: Execution modes for the update path's forward+backward, as `torch.compile`
#: `mode=` values plus `eager` for not compiling at all. A boolean cannot name
#: this decision: the same mistake was already made on the collection side,
#: where the one mode a boolean could select turned out to be slower than eager
#: (`ROLLOUT_FORWARD_MODES`). `default` is Inductor's fusion without CUDA
#: graphs, `reduce-overhead` adds graph capture, and the `max-autotune` pair
#: separates benchmarked kernel selection from that capture so a win is
#: attributable to one of them rather than to both at once.

    # entropy of a two-way choice taken 96.9% one way. That policy cannot find
    # a reward it has never sampled.
    #
    # Sampling temperature cannot supply the exploration instead: `rollout.py`
    # rejects any learner temperature other than 1.0, because the replay-parity
    # contract needs the update forward to reproduce the sampler's likelihoods.
    # So the policy's own entropy is the only exploration that exists, and this

    # the ratio covers and divided by the surrogate's own denominator, so it

    # variants (`runs/ppo-frontier-20260928`,
    # `artifacts/probes/ppo-frontier-20260928/ablations/evaluation`). A policy

    #    gradient direction and the effective auxiliary weight. Polar
    #    Express opens by dividing by its input's Frobenius norm
    #    (`optim.py:58-64`), so a NorMuon matrix step is exactly invariant to any
    #    uniform rescaling of the gradient. Adam is invariant only where epsilon

#: refused on any other; a `lejepa` launch that states none of these inherits
#: them from `family_ppo_defaults`.
#:
#: * The objective's weights are `../le-wm`'s: unit prediction, SIGReg 0.09. It
#:   stays on for PPO from a clone: at the promoted actor rate, dropping it let
#:   the policy drift from 0.936 to 0.714 argmax against its own clone at the
#:   thirty-minute endpoint, which reads as the objective anchoring the shared
#:   backbone (artifacts/probes/ppo-stage3-20260927). The reward head stays off:
#:   under terminal-outcome rewards it predicts one sparse step per episode, and
#:   every measured recipe ran without it.
#: * The backbone steps at 1.5e-5 rather than the actor's rate. It moves under
#:   the summed objective and policy gradient every minibatch, and the slower
#:   backbone beat the full-rate run from the same clone (docs/experiments/jepa-runs.md, job 9281
#:   against 9275); every 2026-09-27 stage ran it.
#: * The update retains the actor's farm activations rather than replaying them
#:   for the objective's belief: at the 4096-row minibatch it fits, 17.2 GiB at
#:   peak (+4 GiB), and is 0.36 s (5.4%) faster per wave for the same function
#:   (artifacts/probes/ppo-speed-20260927). Other families' memory without
#:   replay is unmeasured, so they keep `PpoConfig`'s replay.

    Runs the same staging, minibatch slicing, and policy forward as the PPO
    update and compares its log-likelihoods with those of the distribution that
    actually sampled the rollout. The replay is diagnostic only: the surrogate
    itself uses the stored sampler likelihoods, so this divergence is also
    present in its importance ratio. Pass the production `use_bfloat16` flag so
    the audited path is the deployed one.

    Two statistics are gated, both means over active components and therefore
    both invariant to rollout size. `update_replay_max_kl` is the k3 divergence
    estimator, an estimate of KL(sampling policy || update policy) under the
    sampling distribution — the bias itself. `update_replay_max_tail_fraction`
    is the share of sampled actions the two paths disagree about by more than
    `UPDATE_REPLAY_TAIL_LOGPROB`, which is what catches a localized defect that
    a mean would dilute. The per-head maxima are retained as diagnostics — they
    locate the worst component when something does go wrong — but they are
    extreme values over hundreds of thousands of samples, so they grow with the
    component count and are not thresholds.

    `rows` restricts the audit to those trajectory rows. In a population wave
    every row was sampled by its own member, so replaying the whole wave
    through one member's actor would measure the distance between two policies
    and report it as a staging defect. `entropy_gradient` mirrors a positive
    entropy coefficient, so the audited minibatch graph is the optimizer's.
