"""Prove the native sampler already selects per-row quantity heads out of an N-agent stack.

Stage 0(a) of `docs/proposals/population-league.md`.  The population wave replaces one
learner plus frozen lanes with N concurrent learners, and it reaches the engine
through exactly one changed argument: `quantity_kind_gate`/`quantity_values`/
`quantity_bias` become a stack of N heads instead of `(actor, *opponents)`, and
`head_ids` carries values in `0..N-1` instead of 0 on every learner row
(`collect_mixed_play_rust`, `src/kaggriculture/rollout.py:1142` and `:1155`; the
population caller submitting exactly that is `collect_population_play_rust`,
`rollout.py:1471-1472`).  The plan's stated expected
Rust diff for that is *none*.  That claim is load-bearing -- every later stage is
scheduled behind it -- and it is the kind of claim that is easy to believe and
easy to be wrong about, because the head slice is computed by hand from
`head_ids[row]` (`rust/kagg_env/src/python.rs:527-538`): three offsets into three
flat slices, with `rank` read from a different argument.  Off-by-one arithmetic
there does not crash and does not look wrong.  It silently samples one agent's
market quantities from another agent's head, which in the population wave means
the behaviour policy that acted is not the policy the update replays, and PPO's
importance ratio is quietly measuring the wrong thing.

So this probe does not assert that the code looks right.  It asserts that a
4-head stack with mixed per-row `head_ids` reproduces, bit for bit, separate
single-head calls made with the same states, the same logits, the same draws, the
same temperatures and the same determinism flags, over a whole segment of an
episode.  Five checks, all exact, all over every array `sample_buffers` returns:

  * `per_game_heads` -- one 4-head stack, `head_ids` constant within a game and
    covering all four heads across games, against four separate width-1 calls.
    Because both seats of a game share a head, that game's whole trajectory is a
    function of that one head, so parity holds for the entire segment rather
    than only the first step, and the states compared are real reached states
    rather than the opening position.  This is the plan's sentence, verbatim.
  * `pair_heads_duplicated` -- the layout the population wave actually submits:
    `head_ids[2g]`/`head_ids[2g+1]` are the two members of an ordered pairing, so
    the two seats of one game read *different* lanes.  Comparing that against a
    width-1 call needs the four lanes to hold four copies of one head, which
    makes every row's sample independent of which lane it read and so keeps the
    trajectory shared for the whole segment.  What it proves is what a width-1
    call cannot: a wide stack plus per-seat-mixed `head_ids` adds nothing.
  * `pair_heads_permuted` -- the same per-seat-mixed layout with four genuinely
    different heads, run twice: once with the stack in order, once with the lanes
    permuted and `head_ids` remapped through that permutation's *inverse*, which
    is the mapping that names the lane now holding the head a row wants.  It is
    the only check that pins the offset arithmetic under the layout the wave
    actually submits, where the two seats of one game read two *different* heads:
    `per_game_heads` also catches a stride error, but only across games, and
    `pair_heads_duplicated` cannot catch one at all, since identical lanes read
    the same head whatever offset is used.
  * `pair_heads_padded` -- an 8-lane stack whose trailing four lanes hold noise
    no row references.  `collect_mixed_play_rust` already pads lanes to a common
    width so a captured CUDA graph survives a changing mix (`rollout.py:1179`),
    and the population wave keeps doing so; an unreferenced lane must not be
    readable from any row.
  * `pair_heads_first_step` -- the one check that pins selection to the *row*
    rather than the game, and the reason the four above are not sufficient on
    their own.  Every one of them keeps a game's two seats on a single head,
    because that is what holds the trajectory comparable for a whole segment; the
    consequence is that an engine resolving one head per game -- reading
    `head_ids[row - row % PLAYERS]`, so seat 1 silently acts from its opponent's
    head -- satisfies all four, and satisfies every mutation below that only
    changes head *content*.  In the population wave that fault would give half of
    all rows a behaviour policy the update does not replay, which is exactly the
    defect this probe exists to exclude.  It is closed at step 0, where every run
    holds the identical state and each row's own head is therefore checkable
    against that head's width-1 call, row by row, with a game's two seats on two
    different heads.  Depth 1 by necessity: the native API can reset an
    environment to a seed but not clone or restore one, so a deep version would
    have to replay every prefix and cost O(steps^2).  Selection is state-blind
    arithmetic, so one step of it is the whole of it; game-shaped outputs are
    excluded here because both seats' actions determine them and here they differ.
    Its resolution, measured against the emulated collapse rather than assumed:
    11 of 12 affected rows are flagged at 12 games and 23 of 24 at 24 games, with
    no false positive on the honest run.  The row that escapes is one whose
    opening mask left no quantity to choose, so no head could have changed it --
    which is why this check is stated per row: a uniform indexing fault touches
    every seat-1 row and cannot hide behind one of them.

Why a width-1 call is the right thing to compare against, and not merely a
convenient one: every reference run submits `head_ids` of all zeros, so it reads
at offset zero on all three arrays.  Offset zero is what every candidate stride
formula agrees on.  The references are therefore independent of the arithmetic
under test, and any error in it can only move the *mixed* run -- which is what
makes a zero here evidence rather than two implementations agreeing on one bug.

The negative control matters as much as the checks.  Four heads that happened to
sample identically would satisfy every equality above while proving nothing, so
`discrimination` counts, for each of the six unordered head pairs, how many
sampled market-quantity slots the two width-1 runs disagree on, and the run fails
if any pair falls below `--min-discrimination`.  That subsumes a separate coverage
gate rather than needing one, because a pair cannot disagree on a slot the mask
never opened; `quantity_decisions` is still reported, since the reader is owed the
size of the factor space the heads were consulted over.

What that number says about this probe's reach, measured rather than assumed:
active quantity slots scale with the *width* of the wave and not its depth -- 303
at 12 games, 902 at 24, 1,938 at 48, but only 352 by step 719 against 303 by step
96.  The synthetic policy driving these rows earns nothing, so once the opening
money is spent no further order is affordable, and depth buys deeper states rather
than more market decisions.  The head is therefore exercised on early- and
mid-game market states and not on a wealthy agent trading in large quantities.
That bounds the probe honestly and does not weaken its claim: what is under test
is which slice of parameters a row reads, and an offset is right or wrong
independently of whether the bin it selects is 3 or 97.

`discrimination` bounds all four checks at once, which is not the same as showing
each one individually could have failed, so every check is also re-run against
the specific fault it guards -- head 0's rows read against head 1's call, a stack
of identical lanes read against a different head, a permuted stack whose
`head_ids` were left unremapped, and rows pointed at the padding lanes.  Each
mutation must diverge; one that still compares equal is reported as a failure of
this probe, because a check satisfied by construction is worse than a missing one.
The unremapped variant is the mutation chosen for the permutation check because it
is a genuine fault at every N: the sharper direction error, `head_ids` mapped
through the permutation rather than its inverse, does not exist at N = 2, where
the only permutation of two lanes is its own inverse.

The verdict is **bit-exact, no tolerance**, and that is structural rather than
lucky.  Each row's sample is a sequential scalar computation over its own slices.
`sample_and_step_into` runs two rayon blocks, one across rows (`python.rs:492-559`)
and one across games (`:562-574`), and both are indexed rather than reduced: every
element is written by exactly one iteration from its own index, so no sum or
maximum can accumulate in a varying order and `potential_cache` is per game.  A
tolerance here would therefore hide a real defect instead of absorbing
floating-point noise, so the gate is exact equality of the underlying bits --
floats are compared as `uint32`, which also refuses `-0.0` against `0.0` and a
differing NaN payload.  The game-parallel block is also what carries the
independence `per_game_heads` rests on: one game's step cannot see another's.

Deliberately not proven.  Not that the *Python* side assembles the stack
correctly: `_quantity_heads` and the vmapped ensemble are Stage 0(b)'s subject
(`scripts/audit_replay_parity.py`), and this probe feeds the engine synthetic
random heads precisely so that a defect in either side cannot cancel a defect in
the other.  Not the cost of the wider stack either; that is Stage 0(c).  And not
the pairing schedule -- the ordered pairs are re-derived locally from
`itertools.permutations` rather than imported from `rollout.population_pairings`,
because Stage 0 must be runnable before Stage 2 exists and a probe that shares a
helper with the code it is clearing cannot fault that helper.

One class a single run cannot close, named because `--rank` looks like a knob
nobody needs to turn.  All three offsets are linear in `rank`, so an offset
computed against the literal 32 rather than the passed argument is numerically
identical at the default and invisible to every check here.  A second run at any
other rank closes it, since the shapes are all derived from the argument and
nothing else changes; 16 and 32 both return the same verdict.

The probe never builds: `load_native(build=False)` measures the artifact training
already runs, since a probe whose evidence is "no Rust change is needed" must not
itself have compiled one.
