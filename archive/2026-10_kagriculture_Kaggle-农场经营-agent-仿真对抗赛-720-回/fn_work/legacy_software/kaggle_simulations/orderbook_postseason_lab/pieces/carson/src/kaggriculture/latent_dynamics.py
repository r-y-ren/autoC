"""Self-predictive latent dynamics auxiliary: NextLat transplanted to episode steps.

Transplants the next-latent objective of NextLat (Teoh et al., arXiv 2511.05963;
reference implementation ``models/model_nextlat.py``) from "position t in a token
sequence" to "step t in an episode", as docs/proposals/nextlat-aux.md argues it must be. A
small dynamics model p_psi predicts the actor's own next-step belief latent from
the current one plus the executed joint action, and two terms hold it honest:

1. ``latent_dynamics_loss`` -- SmoothL1 onto a stop-gradient target, reduced over
   masked *elements* exactly as the reference does. The reference calls this term
   "MSE" throughout; the name is a misnomer for `F.smooth_l1_loss` and is not
   carried over here.
2. ``latent_decode_kl`` -- decode the *predicted* latent through the policy's own
   action heads with the head weights detached, and match the decode of the true
   next latent under KL(teacher || student). This is what makes the latent
   decision-relevant rather than merely self-predictable: term 1 alone is
   satisfied by any quantity the dynamics model can extrapolate, including a
   collapsed one.

The reference's third term (``lambda_ce``, cross-entropy on the next-next token)
is zero in every shipped configuration and is deliberately absent here.

Structure follows the reference -- normalized concatenation, two hidden layers,
residual delta -- while the primitives are the house ones: `RMSNorm` and
`ReluSquared` from `kaggriculture.model` rather than LayerNorm and GELU, fp32
parameters, and no dropout (this codebase has none anywhere).

The module is training-only, and deliberately *not* an actor submodule: league
snapshots, inference bundles and frozen-ensemble stacks all consume the actor's
state dict whole, and p_psi has no business in any of them.
