    A format-3 record carries a boolean where the collection mode now goes and a
    format-4 record carries one where the update mode now goes, and `False` is
    not a mode either time: reading it as `eager` would let a record that never
    stated one validate as though it had. `True` is no better. On the collection
    side it meant `cudagraphs`, the one mode measurement rejects at 5.309 ms
    against eager's 4.907 ms on the isolated forward; on the update side it named
    all four compiled modes at once and so named none of them. A knob has to be a
    mode name or nothing.
