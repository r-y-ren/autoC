"""The `lejepa` family: one shared world-model backbone under two private towers.

The entity family splits cleanly into a wide trunk and narrow per-decision
readouts. This family keeps that split and moves the line: the trunk becomes a
world model owned by `lejepa.JepaObjective` alone, and everything that decides
something sits *after* it.

* **One backbone, owned by the world model's optimizer.** `LejepaBackbone` wraps
  the entity trunk and hands back a `JepaBelief` -- the per-slot decision states
  beside the encoded observation. `lejepa.jepa_horizon_loss` regularizes and
  predicts exactly that. The actor's heads read the attached belief
  (`LejepaConfig.policy_shapes_backbone`), so the policy's loss -- the clone
  loss, then PPO's -- shapes the encoder beside the objective; the critic's tower
  reads `JepaBelief.detach()`, so no value gradient reaches it.

  Policy attachment is the current game default. A backbone fitted only to predict the teacher's
  trajectory cloned to teacher accuracy at argmax and went bankrupt in every
  sampled game: once a sampled departure left the trajectory, nothing in the
  features said which plant needed water. The value gradient is the one kept out,
  because the value target is the noisiest signal in the trainer and the policy
  reads the same features. This motivates the current split, but does not establish
  that an independent self-supervised encoder with raw task-trained actor and
  critic paths would be worse. Here the critic folds its privileged inputs in
  downstream of the shared encoder.

* **The towers are what comes after.** Both towers read the belief through
  private rounds of cross-attention, the critic's detached. The actor's decision slots read the
  whole encoded observation before their readouts, because the world model has no
  reason to copy what a decision needs into that decision's own slot: the economy
  already lives in the economy tokens, so a market slot read on its own cannot see
  it. The critic's tower also exists because a critic that only pooled the
  actor's latents would be a centralized critic with nothing centralized in it.
  Its privileged inputs -- the opponent's unit slots, and the private economic
  columns the seat cannot see -- are embedded by its own parameters and folded
  into the detached latents by cross-attention. Privileged information therefore
  enters strictly downstream of the world model, which is also what keeps it out
  of the policy: the backbone encodes the seat's own observation and nothing
  else, so there is no path by which an opponent's unit could reach a logit.

Three consequences of the ownership split, all deliberate.

`ppo._validate_optimizer_ownership` requires exact, pairwise-disjoint ownership.
The backbone is a submodule of the actor -- that is what keeps league snapshots,
inference bundles and the fused-to-portable rewrite reading one flat actor state
dict, under the `trunk.` prefix they already walk -- but it is *owned* by the
world model's optimizer, not the actor's. (The encoder's own keys sit one level
deeper than the entity family's, at `trunk.trunk.*`, because the backbone wraps
the entity trunk rather than being one. Nothing generic depends on the depth;
a `lejepa` archive written before this arrangement does not load, and there is
no migration, because a checkpoint whose critic carried a second encoder has no
answer to which of the two the shared one should be.)

Ownership is therefore stated as a partition of the actor's parameters
(`LejepaActor.head_parameters` and `backbone_parameters`) rather than as whole
modules, and the critic holds the backbone by reference
without registering it, so it appears in neither the critic's state dict nor its
parameter set.

The critic never carries the backbone in its own checkpoint, so a resumed or
snapshot-loaded critic is inert until `attach_backbone` hands it one -- through
`build_lejepa_pair` here, or `registry.pair_towers` where the trainer builds
both towers from a family it does not know the name of. A critic built any other
way raises on its first forward rather than encoding against nothing.

Because the encoder sits outside the critic's module tree, everything the critic
does to itself -- `.to`, `.cuda`, `.eval`, `.requires_grad_`, a `load_state_dict`
-- stops at its own tower. The actor's equivalents are what move the encoder,
and the trainer's `actor.eval()` / `critic.train()` pair is therefore the actor's
call to make for both. Two deep copies are likewise two object graphs: a copied
pair comes back unshared and must be re-paired.

The clone loss alone does not define this family: without its objective the
backbone would be an entity trunk under another name, and with the detached
ablation (`policy_shapes_backbone=False`) the heads would fit a readout over an
encoder at initialization. `scripts/train_bc.py` therefore clones this family only
beside its `JepaObjective`, which trains the backbone on the demonstration
transitions while the heads clone, and refuses it without one. PPO likewise steps the backbone only
on the minibatches where the policy steps: the heads read it, so a backbone that
kept moving after a KL stop would move the policy outside its trust region.
